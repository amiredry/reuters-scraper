revenue jumped 24.9 percent from a year earlier thanks largely
to a bigger take of taxes on businesses and consumer sales, the
government said on Tuesday. The month's tax revenue of 14.12 billion pesos ($4.57
billion) was just below the median forecast of 14.20 billion
pesos by seven local and international analysts surveyed last
week by Reuters. Their estimates ranged between 13.26 billion
and 15.13 billion pesos. The government also said tax receipts had reached a record
150.01 billion pesos in 2006 -- an increase of 25.8 percent on
2005. Alberto Abad, the head of the South American country's tax
agency, told a news conference the annual collection figure
would represent 23.2 percent of gross domestic product. "The earnings obtained from value-added tax, companies'
staff-linked contributions and taxes on earnings explain 69
percent of the growth in tax receipts," he said. Argentina, Latin America's No. 3 economy, is on track to
grow strongly for the fourth straight year, recovering from
deep crisis in 2001-02. In the first 10 months of 2006, the
Argentine economy expanded by 8.5 percent. "The target was exceeded due to the greater-than-expected
economic activity and an improvement in tax-paying compliance,"
the tax agency said in a statement. In its budget for 2006, the government of President Nestor
Kirchner originally forecast a tax revenue of 132.4 billion
pesos based on economic growth of 4 percent. However, it later upwardly revised its outlook for the tax
take. The center-left government has been able to sustain a hefty
primary budget surplus in the last few years, thanks largely to
record-high revenue levels. The primary surplus measures the amount of excess revenue
over expenditures before the government pays interest due on
the debt. It is closely watched in some emerging markets to
gauge a country's ability to service its debt. ($1 = 3.0875 Argentine pesos)
