maker of software for online bill paying, said on Tuesday it
agreed to buy Carreker Corp. CANI.O for $206 million to
expand its services to the financial industry. The terms value Carreker at $8.05 per share, a 5 percent
premium over the stock's Friday closing price of $7.64 on
Nasdaq. CheckFree expects the purchase to dilute earnings per share
in its fiscal 2007 year, which ends June 30, and in fiscal
2008. It expects the transaction to close by March 31, pending
shareholder and regulatory approvals. CheckFree is based in Atlanta, and Carreker in Dallas.
