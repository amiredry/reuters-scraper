sales in Brazil rose 12.1 percent in December to a monthly
record of 204,800 units, helped by a stable economy and cheaper
credit, the automakers group Anfavea said on Tuesday. Sales in 2006 rose 12.4 percent from 2005 to nearly 1.93
million units, a couple thousand units short of the record
number of vehicles sold in 1997. Anfavea said about 2.63 million units were produced in
2006, a climb of 4 percent. It also said exports were about
$12.1 billion. The group expects production to rise about 3.8 percent in
2007 and exports to remain stable.
