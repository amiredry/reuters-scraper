benchmark one-month Cetes, or T-bills, slipped by one basis
point to 7.01 percent on Tuesday, despite the latest inflation
data coming in higher than expected. Yields on three-month and six-month Cetes were unchanged at
7.17 percent and 7.20 percent at the central bank's weekly
auction. Mexican consumer prices climbed a higher-than-expected 0.39
percent in the first half of December, making it less likely
annual inflation will end the year under the central bank's
target ceiling of 4 percent. However, confident the central bank has inflation under
control, economists are debating when the bank might begin
easing its key interest rate to boost economic growth. The yield on the 10-year bond fell to 7.43 percent on
Tuesday from 7.56 percent the last time it was auctioned on
Dec. 5.
