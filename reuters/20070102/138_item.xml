Waterford 3 nuclear power station in Louisiana was back at full power early
Tuesday, up from 70 percent of capacity early Friday, the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission said in a power reactor status report. The unit, in Taft, Louisiana, in St. Charles Parish, about 30 miles west of
New Orleans, had been ramping up from a late November refueling and maintenance
outage. There are three units at the Waterford station, including two 411-MW natural
gas and oil-fired units 1 and 2, as well as the nuclear unit. Entergy's Entergy Nuclear subsidiary operates the station. One MW powers about 600 homes in Louisiana. Entergy's subsidiaries own and operate about 30,000 MW of generating
capacity, market energy commodities, and transmit and distribute power to 2.6
million customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.
