U.S. home funding company, on Tuesday said it will skip issuing
reference REMICs (Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit
securities) in January. In its quarterly funding announcement on Dec. 20, the agency
said it plans to issue at least one, but not more than three
reference REMIC offerings in the first quarter of 2007. Freddie Mac's 2007 debt calendar designates monthly issuance
weeks that it can opt to use for new reference REMIC offerings.
