rose to $25.14 billion in September, or 18.8 percent of gross
domestic product, versus $23.45 billion in the same month the
year before, the central bank said in a statement on Tuesday. The country's economy grew by a stronger-than-expected 7.68
percent in the third quarter, thanks in part to increased
public and private investment. The government says growth for
full 2006 was probably about 6 percent. Total external debt was $39.57 billion in September, up
from $37.46 billion in September 2005. Colombia's balance of payments deficit rose to $1.96
billion in September compared with $1.58 billion in September
of 2005, a separate statement from the bank said. Remittances from Colombians working abroad rose about 20
percent in September to $2.85 billion from $2.39 billion in
September 2005.
