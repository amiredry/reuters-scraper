fresh record on the first trading day of 2007, lifted by
European bourses, while the local currency was little changed. The Bovespa .BVSP index of the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange
was up 2.0 percent at 45,376 points. It surpassed 45,000 points for the first time on Tuesday
after closing 2006 at its highest finish ever and rising 33
percent last year. The real BRBY was 0.19 percent stronger against the U.S.
dollar at 2.132 after Brazil's government reported a record
2006 trade surplus and the central bank bought dollars on the
spot market to build up foreign reserves. "The market remains optimistic about Brazil, the
fundamentals are good," said Flavio Ogoshi, a derivatives
trader with Rabobank. Leading heavyweight stocks ending higher included oil
driller Petrobras (PETR4.SA), which was up 2.25 percent at
50.45 reais. Iron ore miner Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (RIO.N)(VALE5.SA)
rose 2.22 percent to 55.30 reais.
