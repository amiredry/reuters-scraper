Simplot, the 97-year-old Idaho billionaire whose firm created frozen French fries and is McDonald's main fry supplier, is unconscious and in intensive care after a fall, a spokesman said on Tuesday.Simplot, who turns 98 on Thursday, fell from his motorized scooter while attending a football game in Arizona, according to Fred Zerza, a spokesman with the Simplot Company.After becoming the largest shipper of fresh potatoes in the country during World War II, Simplot developed and marketed the first frozen French fries.He reportedly started his company's relationship with McDonald's after a handshake with Ray Kroc, who transformed a small hamburger business into an international giant. Simplot remains a major supplier of Idaho spuds to McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's.His privately held company where he is chairman emeritus reported $3.3 billion in sales in 2006. Its reach is so wide that it even grows potatoes in China to supply McDonald's there.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-simplot-idUSN0235426520070103</link><sectors><value><value>U.S.</value></value></sectors><title>french fries billionaire unconscious after fall</title></story></items>
