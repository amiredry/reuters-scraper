reached $22.7 billion in November, an increase of 11.3 percent 
from the $20.4 billion in November 2005, according to a survey 
published on Tuesday. Sales increased by 3.1 percent from the $22.0 billion 
reported in October, the Semiconductor Industry Association 
(SIA) said in a statement. The November sales figure was the fifth consecutive month 
of record sales. For the first 11 months of 2006, worldwide 
semiconductor sales totaled $225.1 billion, an increase of 9.4 
percent from the same period in 2005. "Global sales of semiconductors for the first 11 months of 
2006 are in line with the SIA forecast of 9.4 percent growth 
for the year. 2007 is shaping up to be another good year for 
the industry with a forecast of 10 percent growth over 2006," 
SIA president George Scalise said in a statement. Consumer demand for products such as digital cameras and 
flat televisions, which contain large amounts of processing and 
memory chips, drove semiconductor sales in November, even 
though the growth pace slowed from the beginning of the year. Semiconductor product lines that showed good month-on-month 
growth included digital signal processors, which rose 12.3 
percent, and DRAM and Flash memory chips which rose by 6.8 
percent and 6.3 percent respectively. Large chip makers like Texas Instruments TXN.N and NXP 
have warned in recent weeks that demand for some chips, in 
particular for those in mobile phones, had slowed in the fourth 
quarter because of the popularity of cheaper phone models which 
contain fewer chips.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/businesspro-semiconductors-sales-dc-idUSL0280114220070102</link><sectors></sectors><title>global chip sales rise 11 . 3 percent in nov 2006 : sia</title></story></items>
