Security Council last month to extend the life of the court until key suspects were brought to justice, but the council has not yet responded.Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader in the 1992-95 war, and his wartime military chief Ratko Mladic top the list of six remaining fugitives who are all Serbs, four from Bosnia, one from Croatia and one from Serbia proper.The duo were indicted twice for genocide over the war-long siege of Sarajevo and for the July 1995 massacre of 8,000 Bosnian Muslims in the U.N. "safe area" of Srebrenica.Del Ponte says that the army has sheltered Mladic in Serbia while Karadzic's whereabouts are a mystery.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-warcrimes-karadzic-idUSL0292519720070102</link><sectors><value><value>World</value></value></sectors><title>karadzic , mladic should not evade trial : u . s . envoy</title></story></items>
