highest close in almost six years on Tuesday, boosted by gains
in mining and banking stocks, while merger speculation lent
support in the first session of the new year. Among the biggest gainers, Germany's Metro (MEOG.DE) rallied
despite a major shareholder denying talk it was buying shares on
the market, while Vodafone (VOD.L) rose after a report suggested
the mobile giant was less likely to acquire Hutchison Essar. "It looks like people are in a state of euphoria in the
first trading day of the year, so I guess it can cool down a bit
without being negative," said Jan Leroy, fund manager at
Petercam Asset Management. "A lot of people are still on their holidays so a lack of
volumes is driving prices higher." The FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top European shares,
which gained 16 percent in 2006, ended up 1.2 percent at
1,501.43 points, its highest close since February 2001.  Around Europe, London's FTSE 100 .FTSE index added 1.5
percent to its highest since January 2001, while Frankfurt's DAX
.GDAXI rose 1.3 percent to its highest since February 2001.
Paris's CAC 40 .FCHI added 1.4 percent. Trading volumes were thin as many market players were still
on holiday and U.S. stock markets were closed for a national day
of mourning for former President Gerald Ford who died last week. European equity markets were widely expected to climb for a
fifth consecutive year in 2007, but strategists warned that
slowing earnings growth could cap rises in equity returns.
 MORE GAINS AHEAD? "We think European equity markets will rise again over the
course of 2007. Our forecast suggests a total return of 14
percent," said Ian Scott, strategist at Lehman Brothers. "While we foresee headwinds of declining earnings growth, we
believe that favourable valuations of equities relative to other
asset classes, and supportive fund flows, will provide scope for
further outperformance." Miners led Tuesday's gains, boosted by stronger gold prices
and renewed optimism about demand for base metals, driven by
upbeat growth in countries such as China.  BHP Billiton (BLT.L) rallied 2.9 percent, while Anglo
American (AAL.L) gained 2.5 percent and Rio Tinto (RIO.L) rose
1.4 percent.  Steelmakers were also buoyant, with ThyssenKrupp (TKAG.DE)
up 2.8 percent after Harris Steel HSG.TO agreed to a takeover
offer from Nucor (NUE.N). Banking stocks firmed, with BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), up 2.5
percent after the French bank was France's top M&amp;A adviser in
2006 for the second year running, a report by financial
newspaper L'Agefi said. Insurer AXA (AXAF.PA) added 2.2 percent after its chief
executive told a German magazine it was targeting cost savings
of around 10 percent in its German operations by the end of
2008, mainly via job cuts. Among telecom stocks, Vodafone added 1.6 percent after the
Financial Times said India's Essar group had tied up financing
for a potential bid for the two-thirds of Hutchison Essar it
does not own -- sparking speculation of no rival offer from
Vodafone. In other merger stories, Suez LYOE.PA added 1.7 percent
after French billionaire Francois Pinault declined to rule out
making an offer, adding to uncertainty surrounding the utility's
plan to merge with state-controlled Gaz de France GAZ.PA.  Elsewhere, PartyGaming PRTY.L rallied 11.8 percent, after
it signed a deal with software maker Playtech (PTEC.L) to power
gaming Web sites that PartyGaming has agreed to buy from Empire
Online EOL.L and Intercontinental Online.
