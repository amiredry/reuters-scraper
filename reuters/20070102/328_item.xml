light to "Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith," a one-hour pilot based on the hit 
feature that starred Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. The film's writer, Simon Kinberg, penned the pilot script, 
about John and Jane Smith, a married couple who both work as 
assassins. He described the series project as "'Married ... 
With Children' with guns." The pilot takes place about six months after the events in 
the 2005 feature, which grossed more than $186 million in North 
America. The Smiths have bought a new house in a new suburb and 
have re-established their businesses, but the attraction and 
sexual spark they had found at movie's end has dwindled, and 
they are back dealing with marital issues. "In a way, the show is all about the marriage," Kinberg 
said. "It is a show about any married couple trying to balance 
professional and home life." The film's director, Doug Liman, is on board to shoot the 
pilot. Reuters/Hollywood Reporter</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/television-smith-dc-idUSN0126438320070102</link><sectors><value><value>Television</value></value></sectors><title>abc has smith pilot in crosshairs</title></story></items>
