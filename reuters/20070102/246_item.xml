percent last year from 14.4 percent in 2005 as spending power
in the OPEC heavyweight was fueled by bumper oil earnings, the
central bank said on Tuesday. The price rises hit the poorest the hardest, as food and
non-alcoholic beverage prices rose 26 percent. December consumer prices rose 1.8 percent over November,
comfortably outstripping the 0.8 percent rise posted in the
same period the year before. "The acceleration of inflation is at this stage the major
macro issue facing the government," said a Goldman Sachs
analysts' note, predicting that 2007 inflation would be in the
15-17 percent range. "This is putting pressure on the government not to devalue
the bolivar (currency) in 2007, but the appreciation of the
real exchange rate is aggravating other macro imbalances --
atrophy of the non-oil industry and very rapid increase in
imports," the note said. Venezuela posted economic growth of 10.2 percent in the
third quarter, driven by high crude prices and heavy government
spending. President Hugo Chavez boosted minimum wages twice last year
and expanded welfare programs that shored up his popularity. He
was re-elected in a landslide last month. Loose fiscal and monetary policy has increased the volume
of bolivars in circulation, spurring on the highest inflation
in the Americas. Liquidity surged around 60 percent in the year
to May.
