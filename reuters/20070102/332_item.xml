suits had Japanese national broadcaster NHK apologizing to 
viewers of its New Year's Eve music special for what seemed to 
be a full-scale Janet Jackson-style wardrobe malfunction. The dancers, who all appeared to be topless and wore skimpy 
bikini-style bottoms and feathered head-dresses, covered the 
stage during a performance by singer DJ OZMA, prompting about 
250 viewers to phone in and complain. "The dancers were wearing body suits, but we apologize for 
any misunderstanding," a presenter announced toward the end of 
the 57th annual "Red and White Song Contest." "I guess it looked a bit too real," local media quoted the 
singer as telling reporters after the show, which regularly 
tops viewer ratings on New Year's Eve in Japan.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/television-japan-dancers-dc-idUST13300820070102</link><sectors><value><value>Entertainment, </value><value>Television</value></value></sectors><title>japan tv apologizes for topless new year ' s eve shock</title></story></items>
