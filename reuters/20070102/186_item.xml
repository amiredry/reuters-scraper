large U.S. subprime lender, said it has stopped funding loans
and accepting applications for loans, and is exploring
"strategic alternatives" for its wholesale business lines. Mortgage Lenders, which is based in Middletown,
Connecticut, disclosed the changes and its plans in recorded
messages at three of its five wholesale lending offices, and at
a sales and operations center in Rocky Hill, Connecticut. The firm did not immediately return a call for further
comment. Mortgage Lenders made $3.31 billion of loans to people
with weaker credit histories in last year's third quarter,
ranking 15th nationwide according to National Mortgage News. Mortgage Lenders' retrenchment comes amid increasing stress
among subprime lenders. Rising interest rates and home prices
have led to lower borrowing demand and margins. Many analysts
expect defaults to rise as the economy slows and rates reset
higher. Last week, Ownit Mortgage Solutions Inc. of Agoura Hills,
California, which ranked 16th in subprime mortgage lending in
the third quarter, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. It listed less than $10 million of assets and more than
$170 million of debts, including $93 million owed to Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. MER.N. Sebring Capital Partners, another subprime lender, ceased
operations on Dec. 1, according to its Web site.
