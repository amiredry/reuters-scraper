Cleveland and Tampa Bay each had 4-12 records and a toss of the coin will determine the order.The winners of the Super Bowl will have the 32nd pick and the runners-up the 31st selection.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-nfl-draft-idUSSP14095020070103</link><sectors><value><value>Sports</value></value></sectors><title>raiders get first draft pick after miserable season</title></story></items>
