nickel producer Inco Ltd N.TO said it had cut weekly output by
around 130 tonnes (300,000 pounds) as dry weather had caused low
reservoir levels at its hydro-electric power plant. "Production cuts came three to four days earlier than we had
predicted ... Rainfall is not sufficient to increase water
level(s)," Rajeshnagara Sutedja, Inco's spokesman, told Reuters. PT International Nickel Indonesia Tbk (INCO.JK) produces
between 1,400 and 1,500 tonnes of nickel-in-matte each week. The company said in mid-December that it might have to cut
nickel matte production from Dec. 20 due to low reservoir
levels. "We won't be able to meet original output target. But we
have stockpile of unprocessed nickel ore, which will be used to
narrow the gap in output," Sutedja said. PT Inco, which is owned by Brazil's Companhia Vale do Rio
Doce (VALE5.SA)(RIO.N) through Canada's Inco Ltd, had initially
set a production target for 2006 of about 71,000 tonnes of
nickel-in-matte. The company said it was not possible to estimate the likely
impact of the unusually dry weather on 2007 production. Nickel-in-matte is an intermediate smelter product that must
be further refined to make pure metal. London Metal Exchange three-months nickel MNI3 hit a new
high of $34,950 per tonne on Dec. 15, and was quoted around
$33,350 on Tuesday. (Reporting by Fitri Wulandari, editing by Bernard Halloran;
