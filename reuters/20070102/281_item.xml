before a British court in January charged with being unfit to 
drive, police in London said on Sunday. The 43-year-old musician, charged under his real name of 
Georgios Panayiotou, will appear before magistrates on January 
11. The singer, who first found fame as the frontman for Wham! 
in the 1980s, has had a spate of recent run-ins with the law. He was arrested and cautioned earlier in October after he 
was found slumped over the wheel of his car in London and in 
possession of cannabis. In February, Michael was arrested on 
suspicion of possessing drugs, admitting it had been his "own 
stupid fault." In April the pop star also made the news when he collided 
with parked cars near his Highgate, north London, home. The musician, who has sold more than 80 million records 
throughout his career, kicked off his first tour in 15 years 
with a concert in Barcelona in September. But he sparked a row with mental health experts in October 
when he said smoking cannabis kept him "sane and happy" and 
appeared to light up a joint during an interview on ITV. Drug charities said they were concerned about the message 
his the singer's comments would send to young people.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/people-britain-george-michael-dc-idUSL3185640320070102</link><sectors><value><value>Entertainment, </value><value>Music, </value><value>People</value></value></sectors><title>george michael charged with driving offense</title></story></items>
