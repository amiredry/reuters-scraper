on Tuesday it expects to ramp up production over the next few 
weeks at 16 U.S. and Canada union facilities where workers had 
been on strike for nearly three months. Goodyear and the United Steelworkers reached agreements in 
December on new contracts covering about 15,000 unionized 
hourly workers who had been on strike since October 5. Striking 
workers began returning to the plants on Tuesday. A full supply of tires and engineered products is expected 
to be available soon thereafter, Akron, Ohio-based Goodyear 
said.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/businesspro-goodyear-dc-idUSWEN166920070102</link><sectors><value><value>Bonds</value></value></sectors><title>goodyear sees production increasing after strike</title></story></items>
