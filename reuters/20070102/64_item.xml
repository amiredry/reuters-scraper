on Tuesday, with trading expected to remain thin immediately
after the year-end break and due to a U.S. holiday to mourn a
former president, Gerald Ford. The FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top European shares
rose 0.44 percent in early trade to 1,489.94 points. Among national indexes, the UK's FTSE 100 .FTSE rose 0.5
percent, and Germany's DAX .GDAXI and France's CAC 40 were
both up around 0.7 percent. The start of trading in Milan .SPMIB was delayed due to
technical problems.
