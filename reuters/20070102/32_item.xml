Taiwan's top two LCD makers, have decided to delay production at
their new factories that use advanced technology, a local
newspaper quoted the firms' equipment suppliers as saying on
Tuesday. AU Optronics Corp. (AUO.N) will delay mass production at its
second 7.5-generation LCD factory to after the start of 2008,
while smaller rival Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp. 3009.TW will
delay production of its 8-generation LCD factory to 2009 to ease
a global panel glut, the Economic Daily News reported.
AU's second 7.5G plant was to start producing screens in the
fourth quarter of 2007, the Chinese-language newspaper said. But an AU official, who declined to be identified, said AU
never gave a timetable for production of its new factory. "It is still proceeding on schedule," the official said,
without providing other details.
Chi Mei officials could not be reached for comment. Concerns linger over a supply after global LCD makers ramp up
production, but analysts say lower screen prices are stimulating
new demand after slower-than-expected LCD TV sales resulted in
high stockpiles last year. AU, the world's number-three LCD maker after LG.Philips LCD
Co. Ltd. (034220.KS) and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. (005930.KS)
of South Korea, has said it would ship 40-50 percent more large
panels in the fourth quarter of 2006 than in the previous three
months.
In late trading in Taipei, AU shares fell 1.66 percent to
T$44.55 and Chi Mei shares lost 1.21 percent to T$32.60,
underperforming the main TAIEX's .TWII 1.24 percent gain.
