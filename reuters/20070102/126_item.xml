1,080-megawatt San Onofre 3 nuclear power station in California
was operating at 98 percent power early Tuesday, up from 65
percent of capacity early Friday, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission said in a power reactor status report. The unit, in San Clemente, California, about 60 miles north
of San Diego, has been ramping up following a brief power
reduction for repairs to a leaky pipe in the condensate
system. Meanwhile, the adjacent 1,070-MW Unit 2 continued to run at
99 percent of capacity on Tuesday, the NRC report said. One MW powers about 700 homes in California. SoCal Edison, a subsidiary of Edison International (EIX.N)
of Rosemead, California, operates the station for its owners
and is a 75 percent shareholder. Other owners include Sempra
Energy's (SRE.N) San Diego Gas &amp; Electric subsidiary (20
percent) and the California cities of Riverside (2 percent) and
Anaheim (3 percent).
