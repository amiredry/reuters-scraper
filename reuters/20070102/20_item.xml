U.S. dollar and the yen on Wednesday, while sterling and the
Australian dollar extended gains due to strong appetite for
high-yielding currencies. The euro EUR= was quoted at $1.3284 in Asian trade after
rising 0.6 percent on Tuesday, breaking resistance at $1.3245
in the process. It was at 157.75 yen EURJPY=, close to Tuesday's record
peak at about 157.90. Traders said speculative buyers were
looking to break option barriers above 158.00. Carry trades, in which investors sell low-yielding
currencies for high yielders, were expected to dominate trade
as the new year got under way. "Carry trades are definitely the focus in the market --
liquidity conditions are still very ample and there is no
reason why the carry trade is going to fall out of favour yet,"
said Sharada Selvanathan, a currency strategist at BNP Paribas. "That explains why the European currencies are holding up
quite well and also why the more high-yielding currencies like
the Aussie and Kiwi are also doing quite well." The yen remains the funding vehicle of choice for the carry
trade, ahead of the Swiss franc, said Peter Pontikis, a
treasury strategist at Suncorp. "There's no political or bureaucratic consensus for a rate
hike in Japan right now, so it seems safe to borrow in yen," he
said. Funds borrowed in yen tend to end up in higher-yielding
currencies such as sterling and the Australian and New Zealand
dollars. The Australian dollar firmed to $0.7983 AUD=, its
strongest level since March 2005. A move above $0.7989 would
take the Aussie dollar to its highest since Feb. 2004. It rose
to 94.77 yen AUDJPY=, its highest in more than nine years. Sterling rose to a one-month high of $1.9749 GBP=, with
expectations of another rise in British interest rates to 5.25
percent early this year supporting the currency. It hit an eight-year high against the yen at around 234.58
yen GBPJPY= on Tuesday. DATA FOCUS FOR DOLLAR The U.S. dollar was relatively quiet at 118.71 yen JPY=,
a touch softer from 118.85 late in New York, with a holiday in
Tokyo keeping liquidity thin. Markets are still pricing in at least one rate cut from the
U.S. Federal Reserve this year and minutes from the central
bank's December meeting, released later on Wednesday, could
help refine the outlook. Fed officials have been talking tough on inflation even as
the market wagered on rate cuts and dollar bears will be
looking for any hint of a softer tone. The Institute for Supply Management's reading on the U.S.
manufacturing sector is also due on Wednesday, while Friday
brings the nonfarm payrolls report for December. A reading below 50 in the ISM index -- which dipped below
the boom-or-bust level for the first time in three-and-a-half
years in November -- would reinforce concerns about an economic
slowdown and could hurt the dollar. "The dollar's weakness is also explained by cyclical
conditions," said Selvanathan at BNP Paribas. "Today's focus
will be the ISM's manufacturing report and any weakness there
will keep the dollar on the back foot." Elsewhere, Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Toshiro Muto told
the Nikkei newspaper in an interview published on Wednesday
that a hawkish monetary policy by the central bank would be
consistent with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's emphasis on
pro-growth policies. The comments had little immediate impact on the market. Currency bid prices at 0305GMT.  All data taken from
