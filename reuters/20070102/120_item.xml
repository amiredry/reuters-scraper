edged up on Tuesday in muted trade during a session shortened
for a day of mourning to honor former U.S. President Gerald
Ford. Many trading desks were thinly staffed as financial markets
were either closed or open only for a half-session on Tuesday,
when the United States holds a national funeral service for the
former president. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association
has recommended an early bond market close at 2 p.m. (1900 GMT)
and the key manufacturing report of the week, the Institute for
Supply Management (ISM)'s index was rescheduled for Wednesday. That leaves Tuesday virtually devoid of economic data for
bond investors. The manufacturing report on Wednesday and the
monthly nonfarm payrolls report, due on Friday, could be major
catalysts for the Treasury market. "Given the proximity of ISM and nonfarm payrolls we deem it
reasonable to be neutral at current levels, albeit with a bit
of a negative bias due to the evident technical damage incurred
last month," wrote David Ader, head of government bond strategy
with RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut. The 10-year note's yield -- which moves inversely to its
price -- jumped to 4.70 percent at the end of December from
4.46 percent at the start of last month. On Tuesday, benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR edged up
1/32 in price for a yield of 4.70 percent, versus 4.70 percent
late on Friday. Markets had been closed on Monday for the New
Year's Day public holiday. Two-year notes US2YT=RR -- which respond closely to
expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate moves -- inched
up 1/32 in price to yield 4.80 percent, compared with 4.82
percent on Friday. The Treasury market "is opening up stronger, reversing some
of the weakness of last week," wrote Andrew Brenner, head of
global fixed-income at Hapoalim Securities  in New York in a
daily research note on Tuesday. Last week, stronger-than-expected U.S. economic reports
weighed on bond prices as prospects of a Federal Reserve
interest rate cut early this year appeared to dwindle. "The November data, at least, reinforces the idea the Fed's
on hold," Ader wrote. Home sales, consumer confidence and a Chicago manufacturing
index all exceeded market forecasts. Prospects for the Fed to lower rates by June, as shown by
short-term U.S. interest rate futures, had fallen to about 58
percent late on Friday after being fully priced as recently
as Dec. 21. Further insight into the Federal Reserve's thinking may
come from the release on Wednesday of the minutes from its
last monetary policy meeting on Dec 12.
