I have never asked the opinions of very many."I've simply tried to do what I think is best in the way that I think you have to do it to do what's best."I think I've put myself out on a limb at times, knowingly, simply because I thought that what I was going to do or say was the best way to get this kid to be the best player or the best student that he can be."</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-basketball-knight-idUSN0128981320070102</link><sectors><value><value>U.S., </value><value>Sports</value></value></sectors><title>knight passes smith to become all - time wins leader</title></story></items>
