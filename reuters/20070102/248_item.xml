Tuesday it had promoted Paul Amos II, a member of the
disability insurer's founding family, to president. Amos, who will continue in his role as chief operating
officer of Aflac's U.S. operations, is the son of Daniel Amos,
chairman and CEO of Aflac. He will report to Kriss Cloninger, president and chief
financial officer of holding company Aflac Inc. In an interview with Reuters in September, Amos said he
wanted to expand Aflac's reach into small businesses and the
Hispanic community, which he said was underserved by insurers. Amos joined Aflac in 2002 after working at the legal firm
of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom in Washington, D.C.
He became chief operating officer of the U.S. unit in 2006. Aflac, which also operates in Japan, holds about 30 percent
of the U.S. disability insurance market. Its nearest
competitor, UnumProvident Corp. (UNM.N), has 18 percent. The Amos family has run Columbus, Georgia-based Aflac for
more than 50 years and through three generations.
