(KPN.AS) said on Tuesday it will reorganise in an attempt to
improve its market share, turnover and profitability by serving
clients based on a business and consumer approach. KPN's KPN.N fixed line and mobile divisions will merge in
new groups called business market and consumers market to focus
on clients instead of technology and products, KPN said in a
statement. "We expect that this could fundamentally contribute to
realise the growth of market share and turnover and
profitability," KPN's Chief Executive Ad Scheepbouwer said. The restructuring will take effect from Jan. 1 and was
announced last year. KPN's organisation in the Netherlands will consist of the
groups called Wholesale &amp; Operations, IT Netherlands and
Corporate Center, in addition to business market and consumers
market, KPN said.
