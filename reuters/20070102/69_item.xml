basketball superstar, and his wife of 17 years announced their 
divorce in a statement issued by their lawyers on Friday. Jordan, 43, part-owner of the Charlotte Bobcats NBA team, 
and his wife, Juanita, 47, married in 1989. They have three 
teenage children and have lived in the Chicago suburb of 
Highland Park, Illinois. Juanita Jordan withdrew a divorce petition in 2002 and the 
couple said at the time they would attempt to mend their 
marriage. Local media reported the divorce was amicable, based on 
divorce papers filed in Lake County, Illinois. The two were 
pictured together attending their two sons' Chicago-area high 
school basketball game on Friday. The statement from their lawyers said the divorce judgment 
was granted on Friday. Jordan is one of the world's wealthiest former athletes, 
with extensive endorsement contracts and business interests. He retired as a player after the 2003 season with a 
lifetime 30-point-a-game average. He led the Chicago Bulls to 
six NBA championships in the 1990s and captured five league 
Most Valuable Player awards.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/people-nba-jordan-divorce-dc-idUSN2943412820070102</link><sectors><value><value>U.S., </value><value>Sports, </value><value>People</value></value></sectors><title>basketball great michael jordan and wife divorce</title></story></items>
