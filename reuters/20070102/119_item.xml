1,129-megawatt Catawba 1 nuclear power station in South
Carolina was back at full power early Tuesday after exiting an
early November refueling outage, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission said in a power plant status report. The unit, in Lake Wylie, South Carolina, about 20 miles
southwest of Charlotte, North Carolina, shut about Nov. 11 for
the planned outage. Meanwhile, the adjacent 1,129 MW Unit 2 was also running at
full power on Tuesday, the NRC report said. Separately, the NRC in 2003 approved of a 20-year license
extension of the original 40-year operating license for both
units at Catawba. With the extensions, the licenses for both
units will expire in 2043. One MW powers about 700 homes in the Carolinas. Duke's regulated Duke Power subsidiary operates the Catawba
station for its owners. North Carolina Electric Membership (56.25 percent), Duke
(25 percent) and Saluda River Electric Co-op (18.75 percent)
own Unit 1. North Carolina Municipal Power (75 percent) and Piedmont
Municipal Power (25 percent) own Unit 2. Duke owns and operates more than 43,000 MW of generating
capacity in North America, markets energy commodities, and
transmits and distributes electricity and natural gas to more
than 3.5 million customers in North Carolina, South Carolina,
Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky.
