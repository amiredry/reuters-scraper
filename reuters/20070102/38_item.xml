But they risk putting themselves in silly situations, dangerous situations, and it will erode whatever minute legitimacy they have," Baker said.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-thailand-idUSBKK13121220070102</link><sectors><value><value>World</value></value></sectors><title>thai new year bombs send grim message to junta</title></story></items>
