mobile unit Tim Partecipacoes TCSL4.SA is not for sale, the
Italian group said on Tuesday, confirming a Brazil press report. "We're not selling Tim Brasil," Giampaolo Zambeletti,
Telecom Italia's head of corporate development, told daily Folha
de Sao Paolo on Dec. 29. Telecom Italia confirmed the statement. In November, Telecom Italia said it had received two offers
for its Brazilian wireless unit, the country's second largest
mobile operator with a quarter of the market. "In view of a very recent, unsolicited acquisition proposal,
the board of directors has mandated senior management to
negotiate the possible sale of the group's mobile activities in
Brazil," the company said on Nov. 6. On Dec. 11 union leader Guglielmo Epifani said Telecom
Italia Chairman Guido Rossi had told unions the company was
"cautious" about a sale of the Brazilian unit and had yet to
decide whether to sell it or not. Brazilian telecommunications group Telemar TNLP4.SATNE.N
and Mexico's America Movil (AMXL.MX)(AMX.N) have expressed
interest in buying TIM Brasil. Analysts have valued Tim Brasil
at about 7 billion euros ($9.30 billion). In addition, Telecom Italia is selling its stake in Brasil
Telecom, the country's fixed-line telecoms operator. Burdened by mounting debt after three leveraged buyouts
since 1999, Telecom Italia has been shedding units in a dozen
countries, raising more than 14 billion euros. Its debt stood at 39.5 billion euros at the end of
September. The group aims to reduce its debt to 33.5 billion
euros by the end of 2007. Telecom Italia in November said that if TIM Brasil were
sold, proceeds would be used to expand in Europe and upgrade its
network to enable it to transmit high-definition television
programmes, movies and music.
