Britain's leading shares rose 0.6 percent on Tuesday, the first
trading session of 2007, with India-focused miner Vedanta
&lt;VED.L) strong as miners gained on higher precious metal prices. Vedanta rose 2 percent and Rio Tinto (RIO.L) rose 1.3
percent while BHP Billiton (BLT.L) was up 1.4 percent and Lonmin
(LMI.L) gained 2.2 percent. They benefited from higher gold and
silver prices, with base metals softer. By 0829 GMT, the FTSE 100 index had risen 37.6 points to
6,258.4 with some M&amp;A talk lingering. Traders said shares
lacked direction, with U.S. markets set to remain closed on
Tuesday to mark the death of former President Gerald Ford. The UK December Purchasing Managers Index is expected to be
unchanged on Tuesday, a Reuters survey found. If so, it should
have no impact on interest rate changes or related market
fluctation, traders said. The real estate sector gained after eight of the largest
property companies converted on Monday to real estate investment
trust (REIT) status, which gives them a more tax-efficient
structure. British Land (BLND.L) rose 1.1 percent after it estimated a
one-off REIT conversion charge of 300 million pounds ($589.6
million). Land Securities (LAND.L) rose 1 percent after it
became the UK's largest REIT, and Slough Estates SLOU.L was up
1.1 percent. Elsewhere, Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus CS.L rose 1.1
percent. Indian newspapers said that Tata Steel (TISC.BO) was in
the closing stages of putting in a final bid for Corus, which
would raise the stakes in its takeover battle with Brazil's
Companhia Siderurgica nacional (CSN) (CSNA3.SA), citing unnamed
sources close to the development. Oil giant BP (BP.L) rose 0.9 percent and rival Royal Dutch
Shell (RDSa.L) rose 1.3 percent, but they underperformed
relative to some European peers.  The oil price fell below $61 a barrel as mild weather
conditions were expected to persist in the U.S. Among decliners, mobile giant Vodafone (VOD.L) fell 0.2
percent on a media report that a potential rival bidder for
Indian mobile phone venture Hutchison Essar has financing in
place. Telecoms group Cable &amp; Wireless CW.L fell 0.2 percent
on a broker price target downgrade.
