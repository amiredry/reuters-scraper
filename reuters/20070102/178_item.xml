HSG.TO said on Tuesday it had agreed to a C$1.25 billion
($1.07 billion) takeover by U.S. steelmaker Nucor Corp.
(NUE.N). The deal builds on an existing partnership between the two
companies and comes about a month after Harris said it had
entered into talks that could lead to a sale of the company. Nucor agreed to bid for all the shares of Harris Steel at
C$46.25 a share, which represents a 37.5 percent premium over
the 30-day volume-weighted average price on Dec. 7 when Harris
said it had held talks about a potential sale. Shares of Harris were up C$2.51, or 5.8 percent, at C$46.00
by late morning on the Toronto Stock Exchange, while Nucor was
down 62 cents, or 1 percent, at $54.66 in New York. Harris Chief Executive John Harris and other members of the
Harris family, along with Chief Operating Officer Paul Kelly,
have agreed to tender their stock, representing about 51
percent of the outstanding shares. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Nucor said the acquisition
would immediately help its earnings and would not affect its
supplemental dividend practice. "The acquisition of Harris Steel Group significantly
advances Nucor's downstream growth initiatives," Nucor's chief
executive, Dan DiMicco, said in a statement. "Harris Steel
provides Nucor with immediate and broad geographical reach and
with considerable scale and growth opportunities." The two companies already have a partnership as Nucor paid
$21 million in 2004 to acquire a 50 percent stake in Harris's
U.S. reinforcing  steel products operations. "If you have a lot of cash and you're having trouble
finding places to put new steel mills, you have to go somewhere
else," said Charles Bradford, an analyst at Bradford
Research/Soleil. "One thing you can do is pay it out shareholders. But
shareholders hold a company not for the cash typically but for
its ability to invest. And this is just a way to invest." Harris's products include reinforced steel bar, or rebar,
for the construction industry, wire mesh for the mining
industry and heavy industrial steel grating sold through its
Harris Rebar, Laurel Steel and Fisher &amp; Ludlow units. A takeover bid circular will be mailed later in January to
Harris shareholders. The deal has support of both boards and is
expected to close within two months. ($1=$1.17 Canadian)
