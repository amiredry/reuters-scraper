discontinued analog newspaper plate business, resulting in job
losses at its South Hadley, Massachusetts, facility and a $7.14
million charge in the fourth quarter of 2006. The production of Precision-branded analog aluminum plates
was interrupted after a chemical release at the South Hadley
facility in October, the digital imaging technology company
said in a statement. The analog newspaper products and market were not
consistent with the company's strategy to focus on advanced
products and did not provide a meaningful contribution to its
earnings, the statement said. The company expects fourth-quarter revenue from Precision
analog plate to be below $1 million compared with $3.3 million
in the September quarter. Presstek expects the discontinued operations to have a
negligible negative impact on 2007 earnings. The decision to stop the operation will not affect the
production of digital plates in a separate but adjacent
facility at the South Hadley complex, the company added.
