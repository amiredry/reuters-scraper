$5 billion hedge fund group, said on Tuesday it plans a proxy
campaign to elect seven new directors on the board of Ryerson
Inc. (RYI.N), a metals processing company that it says is
underperforming rivals. New York-based Harbinger, which owns a 9.7 percent stake in
Ryerson, launched its proxy campaign several weeks after
disclosing it was considering "a range of actions" to pressure
Ryerson to improve its performance. "The current board has not fulfilled its responsibility to
enhance value for shareholders," Harbinger said in a statement.
It said Ryerson has "consistently underperformed its industry
peers on a variety of key performance metrics, including gross,
operating and net margins and that peer companies have
consistently turned inventory more rapidly than Ryerson." Ryerson said it had received notice from Harbinger of the
fund's proxy campaign and forwarded it to its board for
review. In early November, Ryerson reported third-quarter profit
fell to $21.6 million, or 77 cents a share, from $30.7 million,
or $1.18 a share, a year earlier. The 2005 quarter included
gains totaling 72 cents a share. Ryerson's shares closed down 30 cents, or 1.2 percent, at
$25.09 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares
have traded in a range between $19.60 and $33.20 over the last
52 weeks. Harbinger operates two hedge funds, one with a strategy
that seeks to benefit from corporate restructurings and
another that takes positions in distressed company debt. The hedge fund group said it will file notification this
week with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of plans
for the proxy campaign. It said it would also introduce a
shareholder proposal to "deter" the current board from
instituting "obstacles" to electing the Harbinger nominees. It didn't specify what issues it was concerned about, but
some common defenses to dissident shareholder proposals include
expanding a board or instituting a "staggered board" provision
to prevent the election of a whole new board in any one year. Harbinger said Ryerson has been pursing the right strategy
in cutting costs and improving productivity. But current
management has "failed to execute on this strategy and requires
better counsel." Harbinger will seek election of the following individuals
to the Ryerson board: Keith Butler, owner of BCS Placements
LLC, a broker dealer; Eugene Davis, chairman of Atlas Air
Worldwide Holdings Inc.; Daniel Dienst, chairman of Metal
Management Inc.; Richard Kochersperger, director of Food
Marketing Group; Larry Liebovich, retired former president of
Liebovich Steel &amp; Aluminum Co.; Gerald Morris, chief executive
of Intalite International NV, a diversified holding company;
and Allen Ritchie, a private investor. Harbinger said none of its nominees work for the fund.
