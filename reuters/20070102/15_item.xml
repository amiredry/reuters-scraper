Raymond Felton added 22 points and nine assists and Adam Morrison had 18 points.Emeka Okafor hauled down 14 rebounds for the Bobcats and also had 12 points, as Charlotte shot 52 percent from the field to 49 percent for Minnesota.*Tony Allen scored 22 points as the Boston Celtics snapped a six-game losing streak with a 89-81 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. Portland has lost three straight.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-nba-idUSSP14743020070102</link><sectors><value><value>Sports</value></value></sectors><title>garnett enjoys return to old ball in minnesota victory</title></story></items>
