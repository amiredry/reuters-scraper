STA.N will stop paying contingent commissions to insurance
agents and brokers by the start of 2008, according to a
statement by Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal on
Tuesday. Blumenthal said that St. Paul, one of the largest property
casualty insurers, had said in a letter to his office that it
would comply with a settlement reached last year with
Connecticut, Illinois and New York to ban the practice for
certain types of coverage. Contingent commissions are monies given by insurers to
agents who bring in large amounts of business to the insurers.
But they also represent a potential conflict of interest,
regulators say, because brokers are supposed to be working for
the client company, not the insurer.
