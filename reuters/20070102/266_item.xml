the fourth consecutive month from year-earlier levels in
November, depressed by a sharp drop in gold production, the
government's statistics institute INEI said on Tuesday. The institute said combined mining, oil and natural gas
production, normally the main driver in the South American
country's fast-growing economy, fell 7.06 percent in November
from the same month of 2005. The metals mining sector alone fell 8.85 percent from a
year ago, with gold production down a steep 28.15 percent,
mainly due to a fall in the grade of ore extracted at the
Yanacocha mine -- Latin America's biggest. Peru is the world's
fifth-biggest gold producer. Yanacocha is majority-owned by U.S. company Newmont Mining
Corp (NEM.N). Tin output fell 13.36 percent, INEI said. Ore grades have
been falling at the country's only tin miner, Minsur
(MINi.LM). Nevertheless, Peru produced 13.88 percent more copper, 4.89
percent more zinc and 6.14 percent more silver than in November
2005, the institute said. Peru is the world's No. 2 silver
producer and the third-biggest miner of copper and zinc. More
than half of the country's exports earnings come from mining. In the meantime, the country pumped 15.51 percent more oil
and 2.44 percent more gas than a year earlier. The institute also said agriculture output rose 8.09
percent from a year ago. Peru's economy has been enjoying robust growth since 2002,
fueled by exports and construction boom amid strong consumer
spending. Despite the recent drop in mining output, the economy is
expected to have grown 7.5 percent in 2006, the highest growth
rate since 1995, according to government estimates.
