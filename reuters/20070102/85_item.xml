completed its acquisition of Israel's Jungo Ltd., which develops
residential gateway software. NDS said a month ago it would acquire Jungo for up to $107.5

hitting certain targets in the 12 months after the deal is
completed. NDS, a majority owned subsidiary of News Corp. NWS.N, is
headquartered in Britain with development centres in Israel and
elsewhere. Jungo, whose customers include Cisco (CSCO.O) and Siemens

NDS under the leadership of the current management team. Jungo's investors include Intel Capital, the venture capital
arm of Intel Corp. (INTC.O).
