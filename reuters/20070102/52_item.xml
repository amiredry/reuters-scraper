Van der Moolen Holding VDMN.ASVDM.N said on Tuesday it had
issued 1.9 million new shares as part of a settlement of the
earn-out agreement on its Curvalue acquisition. An amount of 940,679 euros ($1.24 million) was paid in
December 2006, as part of the agreement, Van der Moolen said in
a statement. "The amount of the earn-out payment is based on the
profitability of Curvalue in 2005 relative to pre-established
profit targets," the company said. The Curvalue acquisition was completed in January 2006 and
its founder Richard den Drijver was appointed as Van der
Moolens's new chief executive. Van der Moolen shares were up 0.9 percent at around 0815 GMT
on Tuesday in line with the Dutch Midcap-index which was up 0.6
percent. Van der Moolen is also listed in New York VDM.N where it
is one of the top-five market makers. The bulk of the group's
trading income is generated in the United States.
