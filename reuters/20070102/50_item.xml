(005380.KS) said on Tuesday it expected global revenue growth to more than double in 2007, boosted by higher sales abroad and increase in sales of high-end models.The world's No. 6 carmaker, also announcing a small fall in December 2006 car sales volume, said it expected revenue to jump by 13.5 percent to 42 trillion won ($45 billion) after it rose 5.7 percent in 2006.Hyundai envisages a brighter year in 2007 after it saw profits last year squeezed by losses from labor unrest and stronger won currency KRW=.Growth in overall sales at Hyundai is expected to accelerate this year, fueled by healthy overseas sales of premium cars recently launched including the Santa Fe sport utility vehicle (SUV), analysts said."Hyundai is expected to accomplish the target as productions at home and abroad will be able to meet demand abroad," said Yong Dae-in, an auto analyst at Goodmorning Shinhan Securities.Hyundai Motor's global sales rose to 37 trillion won in 2006 from 35 trillion in 2005, a Hyundai official said.The 2007 revenue forecast includes sales at Hyundai's overseas units. Sales from its South Korean based production units only are expected to rise 7.3 percent this year to about 31 trillion won, according to analysts polled by Reuters Estimates.But some analysts said Hyundai's sales target was too aggressive as local sales were seen under pressure amid sluggish domestic demand in Asia's third-largest economy and lack of new models."There is no room for Hyundai's sales to increase as Hyundai does not have a specific new model to boost sales and as consumer sentiment is still weak," said Choi Dae-sik, an analyst at CJ Investment Securities.Hyundai aims to sell 2.735 million vehicles in 2007, up 9.4 percent from 2.501 million sold last year."We will meet the target by growth in overseas sales as we plan to ship the Veracruz SUV to the U.S. in March and to launch the 'FD' in May," Jake Jang, a Hyundai spokesman said, referring a compact model for the European market."We also aim to increase sales at home with aggressive marketing although domestic consumption has not revived yet," he added.In December 2006, Hyundai sold 247,254 vehicles, 1.5 percent lower than a year ago when South Korea's customers rushed to show rooms for new cars before a tax benefit expired.But South Korea's five auto makers reported a 4.5 percent rise in sales volume last month, helped by higher exports.Hyundai's affiliate Kia Motors Corp. (000270.KS), the country's No. 2 auto maker, said it aimed to sell 1.54 million vehicles in 2007, up 22.1 percent from 2006. It targets 22 trillion won in revenue, up 15.8 percent.Neither company provided profit forecasts and officials from the auto makers declined to comment on profits.Hyundai Motor group, which includes affiliates such as Hyundai Steel Co. (004020.KS) and parts maker Hyundai Mobis Co. (012330.KS), aims to increase its group-wide sales by 14 percent to 106 trillion won, with exports of $40.1 billion.Shares in Hyundai rose 0.15 percent to 67,500 won compared with a 0.06 percent gain in the broader market .KS11. Kia was up 0.4 percent up at 13,500 won.Hit by weaker profits, shares in Hyundai fell 30.7 percent in all of 2006, lagging the wider market's .KS11 4 percent gain. Kia shares dropped 49.3 percent last year.($1=929.5 Won)(Additional reporting by Rhee So-eui and Jang Se-ra)</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-hyundaimotor-sales-idUSSEO13893220070102</link><sectors></sectors><title>hyundai targets 2007 revenue growth spurt</title></story></items>
