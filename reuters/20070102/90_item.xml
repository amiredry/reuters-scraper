General Corp. 6280.TW said on Tuesday that it would discuss
later this week an offer by U.S. Fairchild Semiconductor
International Inc. FCS.N to acquire the Taiwan firm.
 At its board meeting slated for Thursday, System General
would discuss issues related to the planned takeover, the company
said in a brief statement to the Taiwan Stock Exchange, without
giving further details. In a separate statement on Tuesday, Fairchild Semiconductor,
a maker of power management and analog microchips, said it
expects to launch a tender offer to acquire 100 percent of the
outstanding shares of System General for T$93 ($2.86) per share
through a wholly owned Fairchild subsidiary.
 That would represent a premium of 1.3 percent over the Taiwan
firm's closing price of T$91.80 on Tuesday.
The news came after the Taipei stock market closed on
Tuesday, when System General shares gained 0.88 percent. Taiwan's
main TAIEX share index .TWII rose 1.24 percent."Acquiring System General is a natural extension of Fairchild's
business strategy to invest aggressively to expand our sales and
margins by pursuing fast-growing power analog markets," Fairchild
President and CEO Mark Thompson said in the statement. "Over two thirds of the worldwide power management IC market
is in Asia, with six of the top 10 worldwide power supply OEMs
(original equipment manufacturers) located in Taiwan," Thompson
said. Fairchild said it expects the tender offer will be launched on
Tuesday and remain open for 30 days.
