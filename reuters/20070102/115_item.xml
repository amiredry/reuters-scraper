dismissed efforts by investor Francois Pinault to keep his
options open on whether to launch a bid and urged regulators to
put greater pressure on him to be clear. Asked by the AMF financial regulator to clarify his position
following newspaper reports about a possible bid for Suez,
Pinault's Artemis firm said earlier on Tuesday that it had taken
no decision at the moment and was keeping all options open. Suez retorted with a statement calling Pinault's declaration
"vague and imprecise" and said his group had given no indication
of its real intentions. "As a result, Suez is once again asking the French
securities regulator Autorite des Marches Financiers to enforce
the new regulations and get the Pinault Group to unequivocally
clarify its intebntions regarding a Suez bid or else relinquish
them for a 6-month period." An AMF spokeswoman said it had nothing to add to an earlier
indication that it was studying Pinault's statement.
