currently being stalked by U.S. rival Nasdaq Stock Markets 
(NDAQ.O), said on Sunday companies listing on its markets 
raised a record 27.9 billion pounds ($54.83 billion) in 2006. The exchange has staked its defense against Nasdaq's 
hostile bid partly on its ability to attract companies to list 
on its markets. Many of these initial public offerings (IPOs) were from 
international companies, Europe's largest exchange said in a 
statement, including the exchange's largest, by Russian oil 
company Rosneft (ROSN.MM) in July. Rosneft raised 3.58 billion pounds in its IPO. During 2006, the LSE attracted 99 international IPOs from 
companies incorporated in 25 countries. Between them, these international companies raised 13.0 
billion pounds on LSE's markets, of which 2.7 billion pounds 
was raised on its Alternative Investment Market (AIM) -- its 
market for growing and smaller companies. The strength in the IPO market came despite a lull in the 
summer when several high profile IPOs were postponed after 
markets slid on interest rate worries. Earlier this month Nasdaq (NDAQ.O) launched a 
2.7-billion-pound ($5.3-billion) hostile bid for the LSE, 
needing just over a fifth of LSE shareholders to accept for it 
to take control. The LSE said on December 19 its strong performance 
justified its rejection of the 1,243 pence-a-share offer from 
Nasdaq.
