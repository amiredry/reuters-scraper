APPB.O and KB Home (KBH.N) are among companies that may be candidates for private equity buyouts in 2007, stock picker James Cramer wrote in New York Magazine this week.Cramer made his prediction after healthy debt markets and an estimated 30 percent increase in capital raising by private equity firms led to a record year for buyouts.More than $660 billion of private equity takeovers were announced in 2006, topped by a $21 billion takeover of hospital operator HCA Inc., Thomson Financial said. The takeovers comprised about 18 percent of total merger volume. Many bankers and analysts expect the boom to continue into 2007.Buyout firms have historically bought easy-to-understand businesses they consider to be undervalued. Hershey sells candy, Barnes &amp; Noble sells books, Applebee's operates restaurants, and KB Home builds houses."None of (these) get the rewards they deserve in the public markets," Cramer wrote.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-cramer-takeovers-idUSN0233006720070102</link><sectors><value><value>M&amp;A, </value><value>Mutual Fund Center</value></value></sectors><title>hershey , barnes &amp; noble could go private : cramer</title></story></items>
