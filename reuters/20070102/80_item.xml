level in almost six years on Tuesday, starting 2007 on a strong
note after gains in Asia. The FTSEurofirst 300 Index .FTEU3 rose 0.9 percent to a
peak of 1,496.9 points, its highest intraday level since Feb.
16, 2001, led by gains for heavyweight banks including BNP
Paribas (BNPP.PA). London's FTSE 100 .FTSE and Germany's DAX .GDAXI both
hit their highest levels since Feb. 2001 as well. Trade in Italy was delayed by technical problems, Borsa
Italiana said.
