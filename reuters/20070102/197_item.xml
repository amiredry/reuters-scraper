State William Galvin has subpoenaed UBS UBSN.VX over whether
its Boston "hedge fund hotel" charges fees that may create
conflicts of interest and harm investors, a spokesman said on
Tuesday. UBS and other banks lease space to start-up hedge funds and
provide receptionists and other support, with hopes that in
time these funds will grow into bigger, lucrative customers. But Galvin, who oversees banks and brokerages operating in
Massachusetts, is concerned that funds may be paying inflated
trading fees to help pay for the office space. Moreover these
"soft dollar" costs are not disclosed to their investors. "The secretary is looking into the matter of hedge fund
hotels and the potential for conflicts of interest," spokesman
Brian McNiff said. "The investigation into UBS practices is
going on and is preliminary at this point." McNiff added that some investors are unaware of the
arrangements between banks and hedge funds, though inflated
costs can drag on returns. Hedge funds have been a gold mine for investment banks in
recent years, generating a third of equities-trading
commissions. Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N)
dominate the prime brokerage business, executing trades and
lending securities, though UBS and other banks are expanding. UBS, which declined comment, manages some 400,000 square
feet of property in several cities.
