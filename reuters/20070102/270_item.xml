flat on Tuesday, the first day of trading in 2007, and the peso
lost ground to the dollar amid falling prices for copper, the
nation's chief export. The all-market IGPA index .IGPA slipped 0.22 percent to
12,346.92 points, while the blue-chip IPSA index .IPSA fell
0.15 percent to 2,689.19, preliminary closing figures showed. "(Chilean) Markets are slow when the U.S. markets are
closed," said one trader, referring to the closure of the
American stock markets for the funeral of former President
Gerald Ford. Diversified retailer Cencosud CEN.SN, the second most
heavily weighted stock on the trade-weighted blue-chip index,
fell 0.89 percent to 1,650 pesos per share while fellow
retailer La Polar LAP.SN fell 1.28 percent to 2,690 pesos per
share. The top gains for the day were notched up by salmon
producer Invermar MAR.SN, which saw its shares rise 6.05
percent to 499.900 pesos per share. The stock was one of six
added to the IPSA on Tuesday as part of an annual revision of
the 40 stocks on the index. On the foreign exchange market, the Chilean peso CHILJ
CLP=CL fell 0.85 percent to 536.50/537.00 per dollar compared
to Friday's close at 532.00/532.50. The retreat came on a day when prices for copper, the
backbone of the Chilean economy, fell to their lowest level
since last April amid rising global inventories.
