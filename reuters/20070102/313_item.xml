Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp. (UTX.N), on Tuesday
said it had an agreement in principle to acquire state-owned
Polish firm PZL Mielec, but gave no details. "We have an agreement in principle to acquire Mielec,"
Sikorsky spokesman Ed Steadham told Reuters. He denied Polish media reports that the acquisition was
somehow linked to a Polish competition for 60-80 helicopters,
which could be worth up to $4 billion. "That's not true. There is no link between the two. There
is no Polish helicopter tender at this point," Steadham said. Steadham said Sikorsky had bid in a Polish helicopter
competition last year, but the Polish government canceled that
competition and has not yet announced terms for new one. He said the company would be interested in bidding in a
future competition, adding, "every serious helicopter
manufacturer would be interested in that." Sikorsky announced plans to set up a Polish assembly plant
for its Black Hawk helicopters last September. At the time, it
said it was considering a "substantial" deal to buy Mielec,
Poland's biggest aircraft maker with a workforce of 1,500.
