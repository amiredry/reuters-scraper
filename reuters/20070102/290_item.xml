consumers slipped in the latest week on a continued decline in
the positive view of the buying climate after the holiday
season, ABC News and The Washington Post said on Tuesday. The ABC News/Washington Post Consumer Comfort Index fell to
-3 in the week ending Dec. 30 from -2 the previous week. The
index ranges from minus 100 to plus 100, and its 2006 average
was -10. Positive views on the buying climate fell one percentage
point to 38, as did those on the national economy, at 45 last
week. The personal finances index was in positive territory for
63 percent of those surveyed, up one percentage point. Confidence measures are generally viewed as a barometer of
consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the U.S.
economy. However, economists note that consumers do not always
act in accordance with their statements to surveys. The ABC/Washington Post consumer confidence survey was
based on a sample of about 1,000 interviews conducted in the
four weeks ending Dec. 30 and has a margin of error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points.
