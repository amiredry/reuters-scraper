BSkyB BSY.L said on Tuesday its Sky+ digital video recorder
had passed the 2 million sales mark ahead of target as it
unveiled new innovations for the service. BSkyB said the number of Sky+ boxes had grown by more than
50 percent in 2006, putting it on track to pass its goal of 25
percent of subscribers owning a Sky+ recorder well in advance of
the original target of 2010. The service allows customers to record, pause live TV and
fast-forward through adverts. Viewers can also programme their
Sky+ box remotely using their mobile phone and under a new
development for 2007, via the Internet on www.sky.com. Customers will also be able to enjoy a selection of the
week's best programmes on-demand with further details to be
released closer to its launch. "Passing the milestone of 2 million Sky+ boxes keeps us on
track to break through our target of 25 percent penetration well
ahead of schedule," Jeremy Darroch, BSkyB's chief financial
officer, said.  "The rapid growth of Sky+ shows strong customer demand for
additional services and gives us great confidence as our
multi-product strategy moves forward this year." BSkyB also published new research on Tuesday showing how
customers were using Sky+ to record -- or 'time shift' --
television programmes. It said drama was the genre of programming most frequently
recorded by Sky+ customers, accounting for 39.3 percent of all
time-shifted viewing. Other popular genres were documentaries,
entertainment and movies. Shares in BSkyB, which is 39 percent owned by Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp NWSa.N, were up 0.6 percent at 525 pence
at 1230 GMT.
