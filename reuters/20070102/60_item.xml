GAZ.PA and Suez LYOE.PA on Tuesday stuck to their merger
plan in the face of a possible bid by French billionaire
Francois Pinault on Suez. A spokeswoman for Gaz de France reitereated a statement by
executive chairman Jean-Francois Cirelli that the firm had no
common projects with Pinault and that a merger with Suez
remained the best strategic solution. A spokesman for Suez said the company's strategy was one of
an intergrated company and no activities were for sale. Pinault's investment company Artemis on Tuesday said it had
not taken any decision regarding a bid for Suez and was keeping
its options open. French newspapers said Pinault could break up
Suez after a bid.
