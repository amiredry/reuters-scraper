on Tuesday it plans to review a British Columbia regulatory
agency's rejection of a power purchase pact and its potential
impact on the company's proposed $1.8 billion smelter expansion
at Kitimat. Alcan, the world's second-largest maker of primary
aluminum, said the British Columbia Utilities Commission
rejected the amended and restated long-term energy purchase
agreement between the company and B.C. Hydro regarding the
Kitimat expansion. Approval of the power contract was one of three conditions
Alcan set for the modernization of Kitimat, which would expand
the smelter's annual output capacity by more than 60 percent to
about 400,000 tonnes a year. ($1=$1.16 Canadian)
