He says he could make much more money giving up his mostly low-value businesses and renting out the spaces to foreign luxury brands."But then what else would I do with my days?" he said.FOREIGNERS COMPLAINTraders say jeans company Lee Cooper was the first international brand to move in the early 1990s, when India began to open up its economy to foreign investment.Lee Cooper has since left, but clothing brands Levi Strauss &amp; Co., Nike and the United Colours of Benetton, along with Subway and McDonald's restaurants, are some of the dozen or so international companies to be found here.Swarovski, the Austrian crystal company, had been trying to get into Khan Market for more than three years before it bagged a tenancy here in April.The company pays 350,000 rupees ($7,830) a month in rent for 434 square feet of shop space, said Vishnu Sharma, one of Swarovski's Indian partners. He wishes he got smarter surroundings for the money."They do complain about how the market is so shabby looking, or foreign customers do anyway," he said. "Indians are used to it ... I would love to see Khan Market look more like Fifth Avenue."But Sheila Dikshit, Delhi's chief minister, says she is in no rush to see it made over."It may not be very chic or smart," she told Reuters, "but it's got a warmth you don't find in many places any more."</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-india-property-shopping-idUSDEL30195620070102</link><sectors></sectors><title>buckets , fine crystal for sale on india ' s 5th avenue</title></story></items>
