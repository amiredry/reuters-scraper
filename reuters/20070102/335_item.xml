Verde (CVE.LM), has started shipping ore from a new
concentrator facility built as part of an expansion project,
the U.S.-based firm that controls the mine said on Tuesday. Phelps Dodge Corp. PD.N, which holds a majority stake in
Cerro Verde, said 9,500 tonnes of copper concentrate shipped to
Sumitomo Metal Mining Co Ltd (5713.T) for processing, had been
produced in pre-operational trials. Sumitomo is a major
shareholder in Cerro Verde. "The new concentrator associated with the expansion is
operating but not yet at full capacity," it said in a
statement, adding that it expected to achieve full production
in the first half of this year. Cerro Verde, based in southern Peru, is undergoing an $850
million expansion plan to triple its production to about
300,000 tonnes a year and extend the mine's life by about 26
years. The expansion started in 2005. Some one billion tonnes of sulphide ore reserves averaging
0.51 percent copper will be processed through the new
concentrator, the statement said. The expansion will also allow the plant to produce more
than 2,000 tonnes of molybdenum annually, it added. Peru is the world's third largest copper producer.
