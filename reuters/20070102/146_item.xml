group chief Wolfgang Bernhard is expected to decide whether he 
will stay or leave Europe's largest car maker after a 
supervisory board meeting next week, sources familiar with the 
situation said on Tuesday. Speculation has been rife that Bernhard, a former Chrysler 
executive who was brought to VW by dismissed group CEO Bernd 
Pischetsrieder to lead a brand revamp, might leave the firm 
after a boardroom coup ley by VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech. VW's new Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn will inform key 
members of the supervisory board of his plans for a revamp and 
a management shake-up at a meeting on January 10, company 
sources said. Bernhard would announce his decision to stay or leave after 
the meeting, several sources familiar with the situation said. "If you walk around the offices you can see that everybody 
is waiting for January 11," one of the sources, which comes 
from the company, said. VW declined to comment, while Bernhard could not be reached 
for comment. Investors and analysts have been concerned that if Bernhard 
departs, VW would lose its most credible guarantee that 
significant job and cost cuts will continue, after 
union-favorite Winterkorn of Audi (NSUG.DE) was appointed as 
new CEO.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/businesspro-volkswagen-bernhard-dc-idUSL0293263820070102</link><sectors></sectors><title>vw brand head decision after jan meeting : sources</title></story></items>
