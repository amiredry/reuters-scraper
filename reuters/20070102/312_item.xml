their fourth straight record high on Tuesday, driven by
dominant cellphone company America Movil (AMXL.MX) and cement
maker Cemex (CMXCPO.MX). The benchmark IPC stock index .MXX rose 0.82 percent to
26,664.45 points, while the peso MXN= MEX01 firmed 0.31
percent to 10.7755 per dollar. Trading volume was low, with many investors in the United
States sitting out the session on an official day of mourning
for former U.S. President Gerald Ford. But the bull charged on in Mexico, with investors
optimistic over the prospects for economic growth in 2007 and
over the fourth-quarter earnings season set to begin in
mid-January, traders said in Mexico City. Last week, stronger-than-expected U.S. economic reports on
home sales, consumer confidence and Chicago manufacturing
pointed to a more resilient U.S. economy than previously
thought. Shares in Cemex (CMXCPO.MX), the world's number three
cement maker and the biggest supplier of cement for U.S.
construction firms, rose 1.61 percent to 37.20 pesos. Analysts at Santander said on Friday that more positive
U.S. housing data would be a "positive catalyst for Cemex
shares," and the bank maintained its "buy" recommendation for
the company. Shares in America Movil (AMXL.MX), the most heavily
weighted stock in the index, rose 1.11 percent to 24.65 pesos,
while its holding company America Telecom AMTELA1.MX rose
1.89 percent to 99.76 pesos. Leading broadcaster Televisa (TLVACPO.MX) rose 1.97 percent
to 59.65 pesos. On the losing end, shares in Bimbo (BIMBOA.MX), the world's
no. 3 bread maker, dragged hardest on the index, shedding 1.48
percent to 53.20 pesos.
