Both groups were followed into young adulthood, up to an average age of 29.Children who were physically abused, neglected or both had as much as a 75 percent higher risk of suffering major depression as adults."In addition, these findings reveal that onset of depression began in childhood for many of the children," the report said.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-abuse-depression-idUSN2924492920070102</link><sectors><value><value>Health</value></value></sectors><title>physical abuse leads to adult depression : study</title></story></items>
