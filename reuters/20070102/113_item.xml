937-megawatt Brunswick 2 nuclear power station in North
Carolina was at 80 percent power early Tuesday after exiting a
brief outage, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said in a
power plant status report. The unit, in Southport, North Carolina, about 160 miles
south of Raleigh, shut for work a little over a week ago
following an automatic trip of the plant. Meanwhile, the adjacent 938-MW Unit 1 continued to run at
full power on Tuesday, according to the NRC report. Separately, the NRC in June renewed the operating licenses
for both units for another 20 years. The licenses for Units 1
and 2 will now expire in 2036 and 2034, respectively. One MW powers about 700 homes in North Carolina. Progress Energy operates the station for its owners,
Progress (81.7 percent) and North Carolina Eastern Municipal
Power Agency (18.3 percent). Progress Energy owns and operates more than 24,000 MW of
generating capacity, markets energy commodities, and transmits
and distributes electricity to about 2.9 million customers in
North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida.
