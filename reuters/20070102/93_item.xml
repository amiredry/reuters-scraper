DCXGn.DE premium Mercedes arm said on Tuesday it would recall
almost 130,000 vehicles in Germany due to possible problems with
windscreen wipers. A spokesman said Mercedes models of the A and B-Class as
well as estate cars of the C-Class made between May 2005 and May
2006 were affected. He added a switch would be removed on these cars due to a
possible lack of insulation.
