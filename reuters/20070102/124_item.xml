maker of software for online bill paying, said on Tuesday it
agreed to buy Carreker Corp. CANI.O for $206 million to
expand its payment processing and consulting services to the
financial industry. The terms value Carreker at $8.05 per share, a 5 percent
premium over the stock's Friday closing price of $7.64 on
Nasdaq. CheckFree said the acquisition combines its payment
processing services with Carreker's ability to capture and
process digital images of paper checks. It said the combined company will be able to convert paper
checks into electronic items earlier in the payment process.
The company will serve substantially all of the 100 largest
U.S. banks, CheckFree said. CheckFree expects the purchase to dilute earnings per share
in its fiscal 2007 year, which ends June 30, and in fiscal
2008. It expects the transaction to close by March 31, pending
shareholder and regulatory approvals. CheckFree will finance
the purchase with cash and revolving credit. CheckFree is based in Atlanta, and Carreker in Dallas.
CheckFree shares closed Friday at $40.16 on the Nasdaq.
