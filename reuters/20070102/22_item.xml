level against the U.S. dollar in about a month on Wednesday,
boosted by its appeal as a high-yielding currency. At 0200 GMT, the pound was trading at $1.9740/45 GBP=,
having risen as far as $1.9749 -- its highest level since Dec.
5, according to Reuters data. Sterling and other high-yielding currencies such as the
Australian and New Zealand dollars have started the new year on
a firm footing as yield plays dominate. The pound ended 2006 13.6 percent higher than it started,
notching up its biggest annual gain since a rally of nearly 20
percent in 1990. Two interest rate increases from the Bank of England in the
second half of 2006, coupled with strong data that boosted
expectations for another rise to 5.25 percent early this year,
have helped sterling outperform in recent months. "The search for yield is what everybody seems to be
focusing on at the moment and I guess it will be the focus for
the next few months," said a trader in Singapore. He said trade was subdued due to a holiday in Japan and
volumes in major currencies were unlikely to pick up until
Thursday.
