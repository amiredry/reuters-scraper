Automobile Co. rose 178 percent to 50,000 cars last year, the
Xinhua news agency reported on Tuesday, citing company sources. The company's overall car sales climbed 61 percent to 305,236
in 2006, following a 118 percent sales surge in 2005, the report

auto industry into developed markets, including the United
States. Late last year, the company based in Wuhu, in the eastern
Anhui province, signed a deal with DaimlerChrysler AG's
DCXGn.DE Chrysler Group for the Chinese manufacturer to build
small cars in the Chrysler Group brands to be sold around the
world.In October, Chery signed a memorandum of understanding with
Italy's Fiat Auto to supply the Italian maker 100,000 gasoline
engines for cars produced both in China and abroad.Chery executives have said the company was considering an
initial public offering to raise money to fund its expansion. The
Xinhua report said Chery planned an IPO in 2008, possibly
choosing both the mainland A-share market and the Hong Kong
market.
