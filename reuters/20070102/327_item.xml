over the Christmas holiday season is turning Finnish viewers 
into soap opera scriptwriters -- through the power of text 
messaging. Text messages have appeared on television before but "Sydan 
kierroksella" (Heart Goes Round) is the first show to let 
viewers determine the course of the story: the unlikely love 
affair of teen idol Roope and Juulia, a woman in her 60s. "What I really liked was how viewers turned to the side of 
the underdog," director Mika Tuomola told Reuters. More than 500 viewers took part in the show through text 
messages when it was aired for the first time this week. Each episode is made up of 10 to 14 sequences since the 
plot must adjust according to viewer opinions. The crew has 
filmed some 80 scenes and recorded hundreds of separate spoken 
lines, which Tuomola says offer limitless number of potential 
story lines. But the show will only run over the holiday 
season. Viewers are not limited to multiple choice options on plot. "Ignore him, he is not good for you," said a text message 
from one viewer. "Love is sad," said another. Text messaging is extremely popular in Finland, home of top 
global cellular handset maker Nokia. Every Finn sends on average 47 text messages a month and 
according to media reports, even its prime minister used a text 
message to break up with his girlfriend this year.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/television-finland-soap-dc-idUSL3068798820070102</link><sectors><value><value>Tech, </value><value>Television</value></value></sectors><title>finland soap opera gives viewers power over plot</title></story></items>
