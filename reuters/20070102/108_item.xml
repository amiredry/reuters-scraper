strategy, raising U.S. equity markets to "neutral" from
"underweight" and cutting its exposure to Continental European
stocks to "neutral". It moved to an "underweight" position in the UK and
remained "overweight" in Japan. The brokerage said it was neutralising regional exposure as
it positioned for a cyclical slowdown. Lehman said in an environment of slowing earnings growth,
it believes the market will favour sectors in which there is
scope for multiple expansion, the ability to releverage, or
those with secular growth opportunities. Lehman said it was "overweight" in technology, media,
telecoms, healthcare, insurance and energy but "underweight" in
capital goods, basic industries, consumer cyclicals, utilities
and consumer staples. The brokerage said it retained its positive stance towards
global equity markets and anticipate a U.S. dollar based total
return of 15 percent in 2007.
