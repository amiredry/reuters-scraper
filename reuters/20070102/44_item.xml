stories on its business pages on Tuesday. Reuters has not
verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy. * Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT.N) is determined to push
energy-saving light bulbs with the help of some unlikely
partners. * U.S. regulators are growing concerned about banks that
lease office space to hedge funds in hopes of gaining big
clients. * While sites like YouTube and Myspace crack down on nudity
and violence, new sites are treading into the realm of
unfiltered live broadcasts. * As 2006 ended, the opinion of stock market investors
could not have been clearer: there are blue skies ahead. * After a better-than-average year in the stock market, and
a much weaker one in housing, homeowners and investors in the
U.S. appear neither exuberant nor glum about 2007. * The new year is being approached with worries that a
slowdown in housing could hurt the overall U.S. economy. * Business groups have started using "speed networking," a
corporate equivalent of speed dating, to explore business
prospects. ((Compiled by Aditi Samajpati; Bangalore Equities
