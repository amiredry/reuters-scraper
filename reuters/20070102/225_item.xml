upgraded defense contractor Raytheon Co.'s debt rating by one
notch, citing the company's plan to sell its Raytheon Aircraft
business for $3.3 billion and use some of the proceeds to
retire debt. Raytheon (RTN.N), the No. 5 Pentagon contractor, said last
month it was selling Raytheon Aircraft to a unit of investment
bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Canadian buyout firm Onex
Partners (OCX.TO). The aircraft unit, which makes business jets
and military training planes, has been lagging competitors and
falling behind Raytheon's more profitable defense operations.
For details, see [ID:nN21469961]. Raytheon's debt will decline by more than 40 percent as a
result of early retirement of debt and scheduled debt
maturities in 2007, Fitch estimated. The rating upgrade also reflects solid performance in
Raytheon's government and defense businesses and strong cash
generation in 2006, Fitch said. Fitch raised Raytheon's rating to "BBB-plus," the
third-lowest investment grade, from "BBB." The outlook is
stable, indicating another rating change is not expected over
the next one to two years. Raytheon's 4.85 percent notes due in 2011 traded at a
spread of 0.58 percentage points more than Treasuries on
Tuesday, in from 0.59 percentage point on Dec. 1, their
previous reported trade, according to MarketAxess.
