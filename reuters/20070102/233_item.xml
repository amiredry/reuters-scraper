CME.N said on Tuesday it set records for 2006 in all of its
product lines on the way to a seventh consecutive year of
record volume. The largest U.S. futures exchange said average daily volume
rose 26 percent in 2006 to 5.3 million contracts, with total
futures and options turnover at more than 1.3 billion
contracts. Volume on the Globex platform was up 31 percent for the
year, and over 72 percent of total exchange turnover traded
electronically. That rose in the fourth quarter to a record of
75 percent, CME said. For December, turnover averaged 5.4 million contracts, up
44 percent on the year. Globex volume in December was up 51
percent. The biggest volume growth in December came in CME's
interest rate segment, up 58 percent to represent 55 percent of
total monthly volume. Foreign exchange volume set a monthly record in December,
with 621,000 contracts traded each day, up 45 percent on the
year, representing $77 billion per day of notional value. CME's rate per contract for the three months through
November was 64.5 cents, up from 63.8 cents for the three
months through October and 64.1 cents in the third quarter. The rate per contract, a key measure of margins, is
reported on a one-month lag. NYMEX NMX.N energy and metals volume traded on CME's
Globex reached a monthly record of 376,000 contracts per day in
December, and for the fourth quarter averaged 360,000 contracts
a day. Jamie Parisi, CME's chief financial officer, said if daily
NYMEX volume on Globex is 500,000 contracts a day, the CME
expects to average 31 cents to 33 cents per contract. If NYMEX volume averages 1 million contracts per day, the
CME expects 25 cents to 27 cents per contract, he said. Shares in CME Holdings ended 2006 at $509.75 per share, up
39 percent for the year. The stock peaked at $557.97 in
November. CME said in October it planned to merge with the Chicago
Board of Trade BOT.N, the No. 2 U.S. futures mart, by
mid-2007 to create the world's largest financial exchange.
