Inc. (PEG.N) on Tuesday said it would sell an Indiana gas-fired
power plant to American Electric Power Co. Inc. (AEP.N) for
$325 million and take a related charge of 83 cents a share in
the fourth quarter. The sale of the 1,096-megawatt gas-fired combined cycle
generating plant in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, is expected to close
in the second quarter of 2007, according to PSEG. Along with an accompanying reduction in tax liabilities,
PSEG expects total proceeds of $425 million, which it will use
to retire debt. PSEG will take an after-tax charge of $210 million, or 83
cents per share, due to discontinued operations in 2006 as a
result of the sale. The company said the charge will not affect
its 2006 operating earnings target of $3.45 to $3.75 per
share. The transaction is expected to add to operating earnings in
2007, PSEG said. (Additional reporting by Sankalp Saini in Bangalore)
