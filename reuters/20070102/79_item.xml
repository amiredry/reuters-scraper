Maybe she just wanted to disturb me."Castano moved into the last eight at the expense of Chinese sixth seed Li Na, triumphing 6-4 1-6 6-2 while seventh-seeded Katarina Srebotnik of Slovenia also went out, losing 6-3 6-2 to Russian Elena Vesnina.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-tennis-women-gold-coast-idUSSP17839220070102</link><sectors><value><value>Sports</value></value></sectors><title>hingis , angry safina cruise through on gold coast</title></story></items>
