rose slightly on Tuesday in a modest recovery from last week,
when the market sold off on stronger-than-expected economic
reports. Volume was light during a session shortened for a day of
mourning to honor former U.S. President Gerald Ford. Many
trading desks were thinly staffed as financial markets were
either closed or open only for a half-session on Tuesday, when
the United States held a state funeral service for the former
president. That left Tuesday virtually devoid of economic data for
bond investors. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM)
manufacturing report on Wednesday and the monthly nonfarm
payrolls report, due on Friday could be major catalysts for the
Treasury market. "This is that sort of bounce that you get after the
pounding the bond market took last week," said Kevin Flanagan,
fixed income strategist for global wealth management with
Morgan Stanley in Purchase, New York. "I wouldn't read too much
into it and we are still at a kind of half staffed situation,"
Flanagan said. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR were up 3/32 in price
for a yield of 4.69 percent from 4.70 percent late on Friday.
Markets were closed on Monday for the New Year's Day public
holiday. "We don't really want to make much of the firmer action as
no key levels were taken out and there was little sense of
momentum developing or strong buying," said David Ader, head of
government bond strategy with RBS Greenwich Capital in
Greenwich, Connecticut. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association
recommended an early bond market close at 2 p.m. (1900 GMT) on
Tuesday. "For the week, the big number will be the employment report
on Friday," said Don Kowalchik, a debt strategist at A.G.
Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis. If the jobs data surprises, the
10-year Treasury note's yield could test the upper or lower
limits of its near term range, around 4.75 percent and 4.50
percent, Kowalchik said. The 10-year note's yield, which moves inversely to its
price, jumped to 4.70 percent at the end of December from 4.46
percent at the start of that month. Last week, stronger-than-expected U.S. economic reports on
home sales, consumer confidence and Chicago manufacturing
weighed on bond prices as prospects of a Federal Reserve
interest rate cut early this year appeared to dwindle. Perceived prospects for the Fed to lower rates by June, as
shown by short-term U.S. interest rate futures, had fallen to
about 58 percent late on Friday after being fully priced as
recently as Dec. 21. Further insight into the Federal Reserve's thinking may
come from the release on Wednesday of the minutes from its last
monetary policy meeting on Dec 12. Two-year notes US2YT=RR_on_Tuesday were trading 1/32
higher in price for a yield of 4.80 percent from 4.82 percent
late on Friday, while five-year notes were 1/32 higher in price
for a yield of 4.68 percent from 4.69 percent. The 30-year bond US30YT=RR rose 11/32 in price for a
yield of 4.79 percent.
