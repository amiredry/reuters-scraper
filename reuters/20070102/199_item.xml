and to fix typo on "dossier" in fourth paragraph)PARIS Jan 2 (Reuters) - French stock market regulator AMF
said on Tuesday it would rule within days on a stand-off between
utility Suez LYOE.PA and billionaire entrepreneur Francois
Pinault over whether he should be forced to declare his takeover
intentions. Suez urged the AMF earlier on Tuesday to exert pressure on
Pinault after he declined to rule out launching a takeover bid
in the wake of media reports that he was planning to derail
Suez's proposed 80 billion euro merger with Gaz de France
GAZ.PA. "We are in contact with the players to clarify their
positions," an AMF spokeswoman said. "The AMF college will publish its decision in the next few
days after studying the dossier," she added. The college is the AMF's top decision-making body on mergers
and acquisitions. The dispute between Suez and Pinault is seen as a test of
new French rules requiring a potential predator to announce its
bid intentions or forgo any action for 6 months.
