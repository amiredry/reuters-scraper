sales in Brazil rose 12.1 percent in December to a record
204,800 units, helped by a stable economy and cheaper credit,
the automakers group Anfavea said on Tuesday. Sales for the year rose 12.4 percent from 2005 to nearly
1.93 million units, a couple thousand units short of the record
number of vehicles sold in 1997. "We didn't beat the record but we returned to a similar
sales level as in 1997," Rogelio Golfarb, Anfavea's president,
said at a news conference. "Lower interest rates were the main
stimulus." Anfavea said about 2.63 million units were produced in
2006, a climb of 4 percent. It said exports were about $12.1
billion. The group expects production to rise about 3.8 percent in
2007 and exports to remain stable. Sales of flex-fuel vehicles, running on any mixture of
sugar cane-based ethanol, represented 82 percent of total new
light vehicle sales in December, up from 81.4 percent in
November. A total of 2.6 million flex-fuel vehicles have been sold
since they were launched on the market at the start of 2003,
Golfarb said.
