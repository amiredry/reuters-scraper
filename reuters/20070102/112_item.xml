619-megawatt Oyster Creek nuclear power station in New Jersey
was back at full power early Tuesday, up from 80 percent of
capacity early Friday, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
said in a power plant status report. The unit, in Forked River, New Jersey, about 60 miles east
of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was reduced last week for a
control rod pattern adjustment. A control rod is made of chemical elements capable of
absorbing neutrons that control the speed of the fission of
uranium. The Oyster Creek station, which entered service in 1969, is
the oldest reactor in the nation. One MW powers about 800 homes in New Jersey. Exelon's AmerGen Energy Co. subsidiary owns the station,
while its unregulated Exelon Generation Co. LLC subsidiary
operates the plant. Exelon owns and operates more than 38,000 MW of generating
capacity, markets energy commodities, and transmits and
distributes electricity and natural gas to customers in Illinois
and Pennsylvania.
