Van der Moolen Holding VDMN.ASVDM.N said on Tuesday it had
issued 1.9 million new shares as part of a settlement of the
earn-out agreement of its Curvalue acquistion. An amount of 940,679 euros ($1.24 million) was paid in
December 2006, as part of the agreement, Van der Moolen said in
a statement. "The amount of the earn-out payment is based on the
profitability of Curvalue in 2005 relative to pre-established
profit targets," the company said. Van der Moolen, traditionally based on the Amsterdam bourse,
is also listed in New York VDM.N where it is one of the
top-five market makers. The bulk of the group's trading income
is generated in the United States.
