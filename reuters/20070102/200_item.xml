previously London) By Lucia MutikaniNEW YORK Jan 2 (Reuters) - The dollar tumbled on Tuesday
as investors sought high-yielding currencies, while U.S.
Treasuries kicked off the new year with modest gains in light
trade, bouncing back after last week's sharp losses. U.S. stock and commodity markets were shut to mark the
death of former President Gerald Ford. Trading sessions on the
foreign exchange and government bond markets were shortened in
honor of Ford. Normal trading will resume on Wednesday. A narrowing yield advantage for the dollar has seen
investors shunning the greenback. On Tuesday, the dollar's
losses were more pronounced against European currencies such as
the euro, sterling and the Swedish crown, where central banks
are seen as likely to keep raising interest rates in 2007. "The dollar is picking up where it left off last year, and
that's under pressure," said Alex Beuzelin, senior market
analyst at Ruesch International in Washington. "The heart of the dollar's woes continues to be that its
yield advantage is going to keep eroding over time as the Fed
holds steady or starts cutting rates." Analysts expect the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates
steady in the early part of 2007 and probably start cutting by
the second half of the year. The central bank tightened monetary policy 17 times between
June 2004 and June 2006, taking the fed funds rate to 5.25
percent. The euro EUR= was up 0.65 percent at $1.3285 as of midday
in New York trade, adding to an 11.5 percent gain against the
dollar in 2006, its best performance in three years. The dollar
was down 0.2 percent against the yen at 118.80 yen. TREASURIES POST MODEST GAINS U.S government bonds booked modest gains in light volumes
after last week's beating on the back of surprisingly robust
economic data. "This is that sort of bounce that you get after the
pounding the bond market took last week," said Kevin Flanagan,
fixed income strategist for global wealth management with
Morgan Stanley in Purchase, New York. "I wouldn't read too much into it and we are still at a
kind of half staffed situation," Flanagan said. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR were up 2/32 in price
for a yield of 4.69 percent, versus 4.70 percent late on
Friday. Markets were closed on Monday for the New Year's Day
public holiday. EUROPEAN SHARES SIZZLE While U.S. stock markets were closed, European shares
jumped to their highest level in almost six years, buoyed by
gains in mining stocks on stronger gold prices and renewed
optimism about demand for base metals, while ongoing merger
speculation lent support in the first session of the new year. Among the biggest gainers, Germany's Metro (MEOG.DE)
rallied despite a major shareholder denying talk it was buying
shares on the market, while Vodafone (VOD.L) rose after a
report suggested the mobile giant was less likely to acquire
India's Hutchison Essar. The FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top European shares
closed up 18.36 points at 1,501.83 points, its highest level
since February 2001. Tokyo markets were closed and will reopen on Thursday for a
half day of trading. GOLD SURGES ON WEAK DOLLAR Dollar weakness propelled gold to its highest level in
nearly a month. "The question is how far will it go. There would definitely
be some resistance around $650 an ounce, but overall I am quite
positive for the first quarter," said David Holmes, director of
precious metals sales at Dresdner Kleinwort Investment Bank. Gold XAU= climbed as high as $640.80 an ounce, its
strongest since Dec. 6, and was quoted at $640.10/641.10, up
from $636.10/637.10 in New York late on Friday. The New York Mercantile Exchange's NYMEX and COMEX trading
floors were closed on Tuesday and will reopen on Wednesday. (Additional reporting by John Parry, David McMahon in New
