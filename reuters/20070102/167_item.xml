CoolBrands International Inc. COBa.TO said on Tuesday it has
agreed to sell its yogurt division for $45 million in cash in
the latest of a series of asset sales. CoolBrands said Lily Acquisition LLC, an affiliate of
Catterton Partners Management Co., has agreed to buy the unit
and will also pay $5 million in a subordinated promissory note
in a deal expected to close by early February. The division makes yogurt in North Lawrence, New York,
under the Breyers and Creme Savers brands. CoolBrands shares rose sharply on news of the deal, gaining
11 Canadian cents, or almost 9 percent, to C$1.40, on the
Toronto Stock Exchange. CoolBrands said it could use some portion of the proceeds
of the sale to pay down its remaining long-term debt. The promissory note, which CoolBrands will get on closing,
carries interest of 12.9 percent a year. It is repayable on the
second anniversary of the deal's closing. CoolBrands also will receive a warrant to buy 2 million
shares of common stock of Yogurt Holdings II Inc. for $1.25 per
share. CoolBrands did not detail the relationship of Yogurt
Holdings to either party in the deal. CoolBrands ran into problems after it lost a key licensing
deal with Weight Watchers International Inc. (WTW.N) in 2004.
Its shares reached a year's nadir of just 25.5 Canadian cents
in October after the company said it would miss deadlines to
file 2006 financial statements. In November, the company appointed a new CEO and
reconstituted its board and said its new independent directors
had determined the company was in "serious financial
difficulty." Earlier that month, it sold some of its U.S. Eskimo Pie
distribution assets for $5 million.
