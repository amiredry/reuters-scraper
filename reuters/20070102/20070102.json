They found two groups of pedestrians and said a gunfight ensued.An internal investigation cleared the officers, but survivors and family members say the victims were unarmed and ambushed.The accused officers were applauded and embraced by more than 200 fellow law enforcement officials when they arrived to turn themselves in. Also present were several counter-demonstrators who insisted that the police fired without provocation.Glasser said the state grand jury that indicted the officers did not hear evidence that favors the accused officers' version of the event.\"This is a situation where officers were asked to stay and defend their city under very, very arduous conditions, with very limited supplies, in some cases without food and water. They found themselves in circumstances they did not create, and they found themselves in a gunfight,\" he told Reuters.\"The idea that seven police officers, who would rather have been anywhere else on the face of the earth that day than where they were, would suddenly drive up on a bridge and indiscriminately shoot people for no reason, then conspire, is preposterous,\" he said.In a statement released with Thursday's indictment, Orleans Parish District Attorney Eddie Jordan said the accused ignored rules governing the use of lethal force during the state of emergency that followed the storm.\"We cannot allow our police officers to shoot and kill our citizens without justification like rabid dogs,\" Jordan said.Charged with murder were Kenneth Bowen, Robert Gisevius, Anthony Villavoso and Robert Faulcon.Along with Hunter, Ignatius Hill and Robert Barrios were indicted for attempted murder.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-neworleans-katrina-police-idUSN0235708620070103", "sectors": [["U.S."]], "title": "new orleans police jailed in katrina killings"},

The Republicans want to provide $6 billion in tax relief over the next two years.The governor said his administration will also expand state aid to municipalities, but added that the new aid will be tied to critical belt-tightening measures to ensure long-term fiscal stability. He promised to significantly increase investment in education for distressed cities and towns under a new school-aid formula.Other measures include appointing an economic development chair for the upstate, helping small businesses by reducing workers compensation and health care costs, creating a fund for stem cell and other research, and launching an initiative to provide universal broadband Internet access.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-newyork-economy-idUSN0234399920070103", "sectors": [["U.S., ", "Politics"]], "title": "new york governor unveils agenda to revive upstate"},

A Somali government source confirmed the ambush but said only one Ethiopian soldier had been killed.The Islamists did not claim direct responsibility but said such attacks represented a change of tactics.Analysts say the Islamists, joined by some foreign fighters, may launch an Iraqi-style insurgency against a government they see as propped up by a hated and Christian-led power.Ethiopian planes, tanks and troops helped the Somali government drive the Islamists from Mogadishu last week, after breaking free from its provincial outpost Baidoa to end six months of Islamist rule across much of southern Somalia.\"If the world thinks we are dead, they should know we are alive. We will rise from the ashes,\" Islamist spokesman Abdirahim Ali Mudey told Reuters by phone from a hideout.\"The attack is what we have been promising, as a change of tactic in the fight against the Ethiopians,\" Mudey said. \"We are scattered all over, our troops are almost everywhere.\"In Addis Ababa, a triumphant Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi -- who lauded his troops for turning the war against the Islamists -- said his forces would only stay \"for a few weeks\" while the government pacifies the chaotic nation.\"It is up to the international community to deploy a peacekeeping force in Somalia without delay to avoid a vacuum and the resurgence of extremists and terrorists,\" Meles said.In Mogadishu -- where the interim government set up gun collection points at the start of a drive to disarm one of the world's most dangerous cities -- Somali Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi said Ethiopian troops may in fact stay for months.\"The Ethiopians will leave when they clear terrorists and pacify Somalia. It will be ... weeks and months, not more.\"The Somali government has called for an African peacekeeping mission -- endorsed by the United Nations before the war -- to be deployed as soon as possible.Uganda has provisionally offered a battalion but said on Tuesday it was unwilling to deploy unless its mission and exit strategy were clearly defined. Nigeria may also help.\"NO SACRED COWS\"Gedi said Eritrean, Ethiopian rebels and Arab fighters had been taken prisoner during the clashes in \"a clear sign foreign fighters are involved\".The government has offered an amnesty to Somali fighters -- some of whom it says have been in touch -- but insists captured foreigners will face the courts.It has told Mogadishu residents to hand over their weapons by Thursday or be forcibly disarmed. \"There will be no sacred cows,\" said Information Minister Ali Jama \"Jangali\".Gedi, who added that Somalia had re-opened its airspace, said many had flocked to collection points, but at one seen by Reuters, not a single gun had been handed in. Traders said gun prices had gone up and some were still buying weapons.The interim government's legitimacy hinges on installing itself in the capital and restoring central rule for the first time since the 1991 overthrow of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre.The task is complicated by the return of warlords hoping to restore fiefdoms they ran before the Somalia Islamic Courts Council (SICC) -- which pacified Mogadishu by enforcing sharia, Islamic law -- chased them out.Despite a U.N. arms embargo, the war-scarred capital on the Indian Ocean is one of the world's most gun-infested cities.After fleeing their last stronghold in the southern port of Kismayu on Monday in the face of an Ethiopian bombardment, Islamist fighters and leaders have moved further south.Residents say some have re-grouped in the hilly Buur Gaabo region, just on the Somali side of the border.Tightening the net, neighboring Kenya said it had closed its long and porous northeastern border and hosted Somali President Abdullahi Yusuf for talks. Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki appealed to the parties to \"embrace dialogue\".U.S. warships were patrolling off Somalia to stop SICC leaders or foreign militant supporters escaping, diplomats said.(Additional reporting by Guled Mohamed in Mogadishu; Tsegaye Tadesse in Addis Ababa; George Obulutsa, Nico Gnecchi, David Mageria, Andrew Cawthorne in Nairobi)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-somalia-conflict-idUSL2874152620070103", "sectors": [], "title": "somali islamists vow to rise from the ashes"},

The won will continue to strengthen this year though the pace could be slower than last year,\" she added.The South Korean won climbed 8.4 percent against the dollar in all of 2006.Economists have said the slowdown in U.S. economic growth this year and an expected weakening of global expansion in 2007 will inevitably hit Asian exports.China is South Korea's largest export market and takes more than one-fifth of the smaller country's shipments abroad, although many of the goods sent to China end up in the U.S. market.Exports from Asia's third-largest economy grew faster in 2006 than a 12 percent rise in 2005, although still down from a 31 percent jump in 2004, playing a solid role in the economy amid weak domestic demand and helping to keep the economy on a recovery track.The commerce ministry said in a separate statement that foreign direct investment plans received by South Korea fell 2.9 percent in 2006 to $11.23 billion and are expected to show little change in 2007.In 2005, such plans had fallen around 10 percent to $11.56 billion, from a year earlier.\"Foreign direct investment has been gradually shrinking and the trend could continue, said Lim Ji-won, an economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co, citing competition with China and the won's strength as key reasons.\"There is talk about making South Korea Asia's hub but not much is really happening.\"The benchmark KOSPI share index erased early gains to be down 0.5 percent after the export forecast figures, with key exporters such as chip maker Samsung Electronics turning a modest gain into a 0.6 percent fall by noon.The foreign exchange market reacted little to the forecast, with the won down about 0.1 percent against the dollar at around 926.(Additional reporting by Kim Soyoung and Rhee Soeui)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-korea-economy-idUSSEO14308720070103", "sectors": [["World"]], "title": "s . korea expects 10 . 4 pct growth in 2007 exports"},
{"date": "22:53 01 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - The story of New York it \ngirl, fashion icon and Andy Warhol muse Edie Sedgwick (1943-71) \nhas taken on the proportions of a cult myth, as do most true \ntales of brief, intense lives. Focusing on the year or so in the mid-1960s when she burned \nbrightest and crashed most dramatically, \"Factory Girl\" boasts \nits own bright intensity, fueled in large part by leads Sienna \nMiller and Guy Pearce. Director George Hickenlooper captures \nthe energy and ultra-irony of Warhol's scene, but his attempts \nto give the film a conventional biopic arc end up wallowing in \ndime-store psychology. The central performances will generate \nstrong word-of-mouth for the picture. A work-in-progress version that the Weinstein Co. screened \nonly weeks ago had a rawer, more immediate power than the final \ncut. In particular, the addition of a framing interview set in \n1970 -- with Miller's Sedgwick in scrubbed California-girl \nmode, having abandoned Manhattan, heavy eyeliner and hard drugs \n-- has a defusing effect, explaining what already is evident, \nespecially when it's used in voice-over. Intercut talking-head \ncomments from the likes of George Plympton and one of \nSedgwick's brothers, which provided far more interesting \ncontext and commentary than the current narration by Sedgwick, \nare now relegated to the end-credits sequence. Some of the changes might have to do with Bob Dylan's \nobjections to the original script and threatened legal action. \nHe apparently was concerned that the film would draw a \ncause-and-effect line between the end of his relationship with \nSedgwick and her suicide. (Sedgwick has long been viewed as a \nkey inspiration to \"Blonde on Blonde\"-era Dylan, but whether \nthey did indeed have a love affair is less certain.) Coyly \nunnamed in the film, the famous, scruffy musician who \ntemporarily draws Edie out of the Warhol orbit is clearly based \non Dylan. If anything, though, the character, played by a \ncharismatic Hayden Christensen, comes across as the sole voice \nof reason in Sedgwick's increasingly out-of-control life. \"Factory Girl\" draws a too-easy opposition between the \nmusician's authenticity and the artificiality of Warhol's world \nof surfaces. But at its strongest, it explores a timeless \ntension between style and substance, form and meaning. At the \ncenter of this tug of war is the blueblood gamine Sedgwick, a \nstriking beauty and would-be artist whose unique glamour snags \nWarhol's heart, inasmuch as he will admit to having one. Perhaps the cruelest irony of Sedgwick's story, as it's \npresented here, is that she escapes her troubled family, albeit \non trust-fund purse strings, only to end up in the grip of \nanother ultimately poisonous clan. If there is a villain here \nbesides Edie's father (James Naughton), the part goes to Warhol \n(Pearce). After making Edie the \"superstar\" of his \ncontroversial movies, he jealously guilt-trips her over her \ninvolvement with the rock star. He's an unlikely Oedipal figure \nfor Sedgwick, whose suspicions toward happy-family facades are \nexplained in all-too-familiar melodramatic fashion. Pearce, one of the most versatile of screen actors, is \ncompelling and witty as the pallid Svengali, for whom society \ngossip seeps into even Catholic confession. His anxious, hungry \ngaze conveys envy, self-loathing and a childlike fascination \nwith beauty. As the beauty who for a while captivated him \nbeyond all others, Miller delivers a powerful performance, \noften baring all to give us Edie at her most candlelit \nexquisite as well as her most degraded. From the throaty laugh \nand old-money inflections to the extreme vulnerability, \nneediness and intelligence, she brings to life Sedgwick's \nlegendary allure. Supporting performances are a mixed bag, ranging from the \nawkward (a decidedly unflamboyant Jimmy Fallon as a \"flamboyant \nsocialite,\" Mena Suvari as rich girl Richie and Illeana Douglas \nas Diana Vreeland) to the convincing (Armin Amiri as fellow \nFactory girl Ondine, Beth Grant as Andy's mother and Edward \nHerrmann as the Sedgwick family attorney). Screenwriter Captain Mauzner, who co-scripted the John \nHolmes-centered \"Wonderland,\" indulges in too much explanatory \npsychologizing. But stripped of that overlay, his screenplay \noften sizzles with the self-conscious humor of smart \nnonconformists. Cinematographer Michael Grady ably helps \nHickenlooper pay homage to Warhol's inventively bad-is-good \nfilmmaking and renowned B&W screen tests. Playing '60s New \nYork, Shreveport, La., lends a fitting vintage feel, while the \nproduction design by Jeremy Reed and John Dunn's costumes \ncreate an exuberant blend of high society and underground \nscene.

Specialized RSS readers like Bloglines and Newsgator are slightly more sophisticated and take a little more experimentation, but are tough to put down once you get the hang of them.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-column-pluggedin-idUSN2919201420070102", "sectors": [["Tech"]], "title": "untangle the world wide web with rss"},
{"date": "00:40 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "NEW YORK (Billboard) - On Grammy night, U.K. newcomer Corinne Bailey Rae hopes to waltz through the door her soulful pop colleague Norah Jones kicked open in 2003, when she won five awards including best new artist and album of the year.Rae, whose self-titled debut was released internationally in February and in June Stateside, will compete on February 11 for best new artist, as well as for record and song of the year for the irresistible \"Put Your Records On.\" Although the track stalled at No. 64 on Billboard's flagship Hot 100 singles chart, it was a hit at various radio formats.The laid-back craftsmanship of Jones is a definite touchstone of Rae's sound, but the artist also dabbles in neo-soul and jazzy arrangements on her debut, which has sold a hefty 599,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Sales have increased during six of the past seven weeks.And like Jones, Rae has appealed to a wide range of consumers right out of the gate, a fact she attributes to a shift in listening tastes.\"I think music is going in two directions,\" she says. \"People like a lot of popular music where songs don't mean much, but it's about hooks, production and little catchy things. Then there are people who also like listening to someone strumming a guitar and playing a song. I really admire both styles -- the Carole Kings of 'How does a song work?' and more like inventing a new style of production, like on (Snoop Dogg's) 'Drop It Like It's Hot.'\"I really tried to stay away from what's happening in contemporary music and just listened a lot to the music I love, like Marvin Gaye, Al Green and Stevie Wonder, and thought of that as a benchmark,\" she explains.Rae has built her audience with extensive North American touring and numerous TV appearances, beginning with \"The Tonight Show With Jay Leno\" and \"Good Morning America\" in June and continuing through with mid-December performances on TNT's \"Christmas in Washington\" and CBS' \"The Early Show.\" And, in a booking that proves Rae's own idols are embracing her music, she was chosen to perform alongside Wonder at his December 16 House Full of Toys benefit in Los Angeles. Rae also recently taped an episode of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" with Mary J. Blige that will air January 16.\"I haven't had a chance to really think about (how) anyone could get to hear\" the album, she says. \"Once you've made it and it's out there, it works for you, but it has its own life and legs and you never know who's going to get to hear it. That's been the amazing thing.\"Rae will return to the road in North America in late winter or early spring, according to her U.S. label Capitol, which is still weighing options for the next single from her album.Reuters/Billboard", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-grammys-corinne-idUSN0126427220070102", "sectors": [["Entertainment, ", "Music"]], "title": "uk newcomer a rae of light at grammys"},

Raymond Felton added 22 points and nine assists and Adam Morrison had 18 points.Emeka Okafor hauled down 14 rebounds for the Bobcats and also had 12 points, as Charlotte shot 52 percent from the field to 49 percent for Minnesota.*Tony Allen scored 22 points as the Boston Celtics snapped a six-game losing streak with a 89-81 win over the Portland Trail Blazers.

{"date": "01:09 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "MENA, Saudi Arabia More than 2.5 million Muslim pilgrims performed final devil-stoning rites on Monday, as Saudi authorities declared the annual pilgrimage free from the tragedies that have marred haj in recent years.\"Praise be to God, we have had a safe haj this year. I bring my sons with me normally (for protection), but this year I found I was okay without them,\" said Saadiya Mustafa from Egypt.\"The organization has been great,\" said Indian pilgrim Sayed Yousef, sitting on top of a van amid severe traffic congestion on the final day of haj. \"I was here two years ago, but this time there was more free food and less hassle.\"On Monday, pilgrims made a third and final visit to the Jamarat Bridge to throw stones at three large walls representing the spot of Satan's temptation of biblical patriarch Abraham.Then many jumped on whatever transport they could find to make a final visit to Mecca's Grand Mosque, which filled with hundreds of thousands of pilgrims into the evening.\"Look at the pedestrians, they are moving faster than the cars,\" said Hamdan bin Musaileh, a Yemeni stuck in the suffocating traffic jam. \"I bet they get a better reward from God for walking to the Mosque rather than taking transport.\"Authorities congratulated themselves that the haj rites had passed off without incident despite a surge of pilgrims at the bridge on Monday in the rush to finish and leave.\"There have been no security violations at all at the Jamarat area,\" Interior Minister Prince Nayef told reporters, praising Saudi clerics for offering pilgrims clear advice to pace the stoning throughout the day.Hardliners of Saudi Arabia's Wahhabi school of Islam often insist stoning should take place in the afternoon to emulate to the word what they say was the practice of Prophet Mohammad.It was on the final day of the last haj that 362 pilgrims were crushed to death during the stone-throwing ritual in the worst haj tragedy in 16 years. Another such incident would have been an embarrassment for Saudi Arabia.New construction work completed in recent months allows 250,000 pilgrims to pass over the Jamarat Bridge each hour. Saudi authorities were also bolder than normal in removing pilgrim squatters who set up makeshift tents in the area.Saudi Arabia regularly deploys more than 50,000 security men to safeguard haj against militants and try to prevent disasters.SADDAM SPOILERThe 5-day rites were overshadowed by the hanging on Saturday of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, a hero to some Sunni Arabs over his anti-U.S. stances, but hated by many Shi'ites.Saudi Arabia criticized Iraq for despoiling the spirit of the haj, one of the world's biggest displays of mass religious devotion which is a duty for able-bodied Muslims with the means.The execution also raised fears of clashes at the haj, where police have used force to put down protests in the past.Security was already tight during this pilgrimage season -- with apparent record numbers -- because of sectarian strife between Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims in Iraq and Lebanon.Saudi officials say 2.4 million pilgrims are officially on the haj. But with hundreds of thousands of residents and expatriates sneaking into Mecca without official permits, the total number could be closer to a record 3 million.Pilgrims, mostly on foot, cover a 44 km (28 mile) route around Mecca during the grueling rites, as well as walk some 15 km in at least three visits to the city's vast mosque complex.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-haj-idUSL3090240620070102", "sectors": [["World"]], "title": "pilgrims rush to end rites on final day of haj"},
{"date": "01:09 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Nineteen years after chasing down the Holy Grail in \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,\" Harrison Ford will return to the big screen in the character of the globe-trotting archeologist in May 2008.Producer George Lucas and director Steven Spielberg confirmed details of the project Monday after Lucas tipped off the media to Indiana Jones' imminent return as he prepared to serve as grand marshal of the Rose Parade in Pasadena.After years spent in script development, a fourth installment of the hit franchise is set to begin production in June in locations around the world and in the United States. It will mark Spielberg's next directorial outing.\"George, Harrison and I are all very excited,\" Spielberg said. \"We feel that the script was well worth the wait. We hope it delivers everything you'd expect from our history with Indiana Jones.\"In a statement, 64-year-old Ford said he was ready for another action-packed turn. \"I'm delighted to be back in business with my old friends,\" he said. \"I don't know if the pants still fit, but I know the hat will.\"Added Lucas: \"These films are such great fun to make. I'm looking forward to reuniting with the team and starting this new journey.\"For the moment, the title of the new film as well as its story line are being kept under wraps.The film will be produced by Lucasfilm Ltd. and released worldwide by Paramount Pictures, the parent company of DreamWorks, which Spielberg co-founded.David Koepp, who has penned such previous Spielberg projects as \"Jurassic Park\" and \"War of the Worlds,\" wrote the screenplay that finally got the stamp of approval from Lucas and Spielberg. An earlier screenplay by Frank Darabont was shelved when Lucas turned thumbs down on it.Although a spokesman for Spielberg said Monday that no casting has begun, Lucas and Ford have said that they would like to include Sean Connery, who played Indiana Jones' father, Professor Henry Jones, in \"The Last Crusade.\" \"We are writing him in whether he wants to do it or not,\" Lucas told \"Access Hollywood\" when Connery was honored in June with the American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award.It also is not known whether the project will be shot digitally, like Lucas' recent \"Star Wars\" movies, or on film, the medium Spielberg prefers.\"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" the first film in the series, was released in 1981, followed by \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" in 1984 and \"Last Crusade\" in 1989. The three movies have earned 14 Academy Award nominations, seven Oscars and grossed more than $1.182 billion worldwide.A release date was not announced, but the past two films in the series opened shortly before the Memorial Day weekend. Currently, the May 2008 lineup includes Paramount's Marvel adaptation \"Iron Man\"; Disney's \"The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian\"; and Warner Bros. Pictures' \"Speed Racer.\"Reuters/Hollywood Reporter", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-indianajones-idUSN0130954820070102", "sectors": [["Entertainment, ", "Film"]], "title": "can you dig it ? fourth indy in ' 08"},
{"date": "22:33 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " (Repeats to fix format of table) By Dhara Ranasinghe SINGAPORE, Jan 3 The euro held firm against the\nU.S. dollar and the yen on Wednesday, while sterling and the\nAustralian dollar extended gains due to strong appetite for\nhigh-yielding currencies. The euro EUR= was quoted at $1.3284 in Asian trade after\nrising 0.6 percent on Tuesday, breaking resistance at $1.3245\nin the process. It was at 157.75 yen EURJPY=, close to Tuesday's record\npeak at about 157.90. Traders said speculative buyers were\nlooking to break option barriers above 158.00. Carry trades, in which investors sell low-yielding\ncurrencies for high yielders, were expected to dominate trade\nas the new year got under way. \"Carry trades are definitely the focus in the market --\nliquidity conditions are still very ample and there is no\nreason why the carry trade is going to fall out of favour yet,\"\nsaid Sharada Selvanathan, a currency strategist at BNP Paribas. \"That explains why the European currencies are holding up\nquite well and also why the more high-yielding currencies like\nthe Aussie and Kiwi are also doing quite well.\" The yen remains the funding vehicle of choice for the carry\ntrade, ahead of the Swiss franc, said Peter Pontikis, a\ntreasury strategist at Suncorp. \"There's no political or bureaucratic consensus for a rate\nhike in Japan right now, so it seems safe to borrow in yen,\" he\nsaid. Funds borrowed in yen tend to end up in higher-yielding\ncurrencies such as sterling and the Australian and New Zealand\ndollars. The Australian dollar firmed to $0.7983 AUD=, its\nstrongest level since March 2005. A move above $0.7989 would\ntake the Aussie dollar to its highest since Feb. 2004. It rose\nto 94.77 yen AUDJPY=, its highest in more than nine years. Sterling rose to a one-month high of $1.9749 GBP=, with\nexpectations of another rise in British interest rates to 5.25\npercent early this year supporting the currency. It hit an eight-year high against the yen at around 234.58\nyen GBPJPY= on Tuesday. DATA FOCUS FOR DOLLAR The U.S. dollar was relatively quiet at 118.71 yen JPY=,\na touch softer from 118.85 late in New York, with a holiday in\nTokyo keeping liquidity thin. Markets are still pricing in at least one rate cut from the\nU.S. Federal Reserve this year and minutes from the central\nbank's December meeting, released later on Wednesday, could\nhelp refine the outlook. Fed officials have been talking tough on inflation even as\nthe market wagered on rate cuts and dollar bears will be\nlooking for any hint of a softer tone. The Institute for Supply Management's reading on the U.S.\nmanufacturing sector is also due on Wednesday, while Friday\nbrings the nonfarm payrolls report for December. A reading below 50 in the ISM index -- which dipped below\nthe boom-or-bust level for the first time in three-and-a-half\nyears in November -- would reinforce concerns about an economic\nslowdown and could hurt the dollar. \"The dollar's weakness is also explained by cyclical\nconditions,\" said Selvanathan at BNP Paribas. \"Today's focus\nwill be the ISM's manufacturing report and any weakness there\nwill keep the dollar on the back foot.\" Elsewhere, Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Toshiro Muto told\nthe Nikkei newspaper in an interview published on Wednesday\nthat a hawkish monetary policy by the central bank would be\nconsistent with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's emphasis on\npro-growth policies.

{"date": "21:16 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " The Times ITV INVESTS 20 MILLION POUNDS IN BROADBAND TELEVISION\nENTERPRISE ITV (ITV.L) is investing 20 million pounds in broadband\ntelevision, which it plans to launch at the end of March despite\nbelieving viewers may not be willing to pay to watch much\ntelevision online. The commercial broadcaster, which has been\ncriticised for being slow to develop its Internet presence\ncompared particularly with the BBC, is hoping a \"mixed economy\"\nof paid for and free programming will emerge, providing new\nrevenue stream to offset weak television advertising revenues. HOUSING DOUBT Recent figures from the Land Registry show house price\nincreases may be slowing, with the cost of the average home in\nEngland and Wales rising by 6.8 percent to 172,000 pounds in the\nyear to November compared to the seven percent annual price\ninflation reported for October. Nationwide had recorded a 10.5\npercent increase in house prices as a whole. SKY PLUS GROWS BSkyB BSY.L, the satellite broadcaster, which is 39.1\npercent owned by News Corporation, has reported a 56 percent\nincrease in the number of homes that took a subscription to its\npremium Sky Plus personal video recorder service. The\nbroadcaster also unveiled plans to launch a video-on-demand\nservice later this year. The Daily Telegraph BARCLAYS RAISES SAVERS' RATES Barclays Bank (BARC.L) has increased the rate on its Regular\nSaver account to enable savers to earn up to 12.5 percent gross\ninterest a year. However, this is applicable only to the bank's\ncurrent account customers and the maximum permissible\ncontribution is 250 pounds a month for a year. S&N RAISES CHINESE BEER MAKER STAKE Scottish & Newcastle SCTN.L is to spend up to 100 million\npounds to bolster its stake in Chongqing Brewery Company (CBC),\none of China's leading brewers, to just under 20 percent. The\nadditional investment, which was prompted by a proposed\nrestructuring of CBC that will see its brewing subsidiaries\ninjected into its Shanghai-listed parent, comes after an initial\n35 million pound outlay in February. S&N trails SAB Miller in\nChina, where the Anglo-South African company has invested\nheavily in partnership with China Resources Snow Breweries. LITTLE CHEF FINDS BUYER Little Chef, the troubled roadside restaurant chain, is\nexpected to announce it has signed an 11th hour rescue deal with\ntwo new investors -- the Israeli property group Arazim, which\nowns 65 of the company's restaurant sites, and the turn-round\nspecialist R capital.

The Guardian SWITCH TO REITS WILL COST BIGGEST FIRMS 300 MILLION POUNDS\nEACH Britain's biggest quoted property companies, British Land\n(BLND.L) and Land Securities (LAND.L) have estimated the\nrequired one-off payment of two percent of the value of their\nproperty portfolio to be paid to the Treasury for converting\nfrom corporations to real estate investment trusts (Reits) will\ncost each company about 300 million pounds. Reit status enables\nproperty firms to avoid corporation and capital gains tax, and\nmeans dividends can be paid out of untaxed income if at least 90\npercent goes to shareholders. ROLLS-ROYCE MAN TAKES FRONT-SEAT ROLE AT HSBC Simon Robertson, chairman of Rolls-Royce (RR.L), who joined\nthe board of HSBC (HSBA.L) a year ago, is to become senior\nindependent non-executive director at the bank. The position,\nwhich includes having discussions with shareholders, is\nparticularly significant at HSBC, which has both an executive\nchairman and a chief executive. VODAFONE'S AMBITIONS IN INDIA THREATENED BY ESSAR BUYOUT\nOFFER Plans by Vodafone (VOD.L) to acquire India's Hutchison Essar\nwere yesterday dealt a blow after minority shareholder Essar\nTeleholdings reportedly offered 5.6 billion pounds for the 67\npercent stake owned by joint venture partner Hutchison Telecom.\nThe reported offer pitches the Indian firm against a number of\ncompanies including Vodafone and the Indian mobile operator\nReliance, which has been bullish about acquiring the operator. The Independent RECORD NUMBER OF UK INSOLVENCIES ANTICIPATED AFTER CHRISTMAS\nSPREE Grant Thornton, a leading firm of accountants, has predicted\nthe number of people declaring themselves insolvent over the\nnext three months will soar following Christmas over-spending.\nThe firm said it expected 30,000 individuals to become insolvent\nduring the first quarter of 2007, with many being the result of\nexcessive spending in the festive season. A spokeswoman for\nCitizens Advice said: \"We do see evidence of Christmas debt\nhangover, and this month we expect to exceed the 140,000\nproblems that Citizens Advice bureaux dealt with in January\n2006.\" BANKS JOIN THE CRUSH FOR JANUARY SALES Three of Britain's big four banks -- HSBC (HSBA.L), Barclays\n(BARC.L) and Lloyds TSB (LLOY.L) -- this week resorted to high\nstreet retailer-style New Year sales in a bid to retain market\nshare and win business from each other. For instance, HSBC this\nweek launched the Green Sale, offering cheap deals on mortgages\nand credit cards as well as higher savings rates. Barclays Bank\nyesterday announced it would offer an annual interest rate of\n12.5 percent to current account customers opening a Regular\nSaver account before Feb. 28, while Lloyds TSB launched a new\nfixed-rate mortgage costing just 1.99 percent in the first 12\nmonths. PARTYGAMING IN DEAL WITH PLAYTECH Shares in PartyGaming PRTY.L surged 12 percent to 35.5\npence yesterday after the online gaming company announced a\nfour-year licensing agreement with the Aim-listed software\nprovider Playtech that could lead to future deals in Asia\nbetween the two firms. Under the deal, Playtech will power the\ngaming Web sites that PartyGaming agreed to buy last month from\nEmpire Online and InterContinental Online for 36.6 million\npounds in shares. Analysts said if PartyGaming were to move into\nChina, then Playtech would be well placed to provide the\nsoftware for its sites. Prepared for Reuters by Durrants.

The number of consumers\nopting for insolvency has been fuelled by more people opting for\nindividual voluntary arrangement (IVAs), which is being marketed\nas an easy way of offloading debt.

Some of the new\nReits enjoyed gains in their share prices on their first day of\ntrading as investors sized up the potential for higher dividend\npayouts.

{"date": "01:27 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " (Adds details, Dec sales of other auto makers, analysts,\nshares) By Cheon Jong-wooSEOUL Jan 2 (Reuters) - Top South Korean auto maker\nHyundai Motor Co. (005380.KS) said on Tuesday it expected\nglobal revenue growth to more than double in 2007, boosted by\nhigher sales abroad and increase in sales of high-end models. The world's No. 6 carmaker, also announcing a small fall in\nDecember 2006 car sales volume, said it expected revenue to\njump by 13.5 percent to 42 trillion won ($45 billion) after it\nrose 5.7 percent in 2006. Hyundai envisages a brighter year in 2007 after it saw\nprofits last year squeezed by losses from labour unrest and\nstronger won currency KRW=. Growth in overall sales at Hyundai is expected to\naccelerate this year, fuelled by healthy overseas sales of\npremium cars recently launched including the Santa Fe sport\nutility vehicle (SUV), analysts said. \"Hyundai is expected to accomplish the target as\nproductions at home and abroad will be able to meet demand\nabroad,\" said Yong Dae-in, an auto analyst at Goodmorning\nShinhan Securities. Hyundai Motor's global sales rose to 37 trillion won in\n2006 from 35 trillion in 2005, a Hyundai official said. The 2007 revenue forecast includes sales at Hyundai's\noverseas units. Sales from its South Korean based production\nunits only are expected to rise 7.3 percent this year to about\n31 trillion won, according to analysts polled by Reuters\nEstimates. But some analysts said Hyundai's sales target was too\naggressive as local sales were seen under pressure amid\nsluggish domestic demand in Asia's third-largest economy and\nlack of new models. \"There is no room for Hyundai's sales to increase as\nHyundai does not have a specific new model to boost sales and\nas consumer sentiment is still weak,\" said Choi Dae-sik, an\nanalyst at CJ Investment Securities. Hyundai aims to sell 2.735 million vehicles in 2007, up 9.4\npercent from 2.501 million sold last year. \"We will meet the target by growth in overseas sales as we\nplan to ship the Veracruz SUV to the U.S. in March and to\nlaunch the 'FD' in May,\" Jake Jang, a Hyundai spokesman said,\nreferring a compact model for the European market. \"We also aim to increase sales at home with aggressive\nmarketing although domestic consumption has not revived yet,\"\nhe added. In December 2006, Hyundai sold 247,254 vehicles, 1.5\npercent lower than a year ago when South Korea's customers\nrushed to show rooms for new cars before a tax benefit expired. But South Korea's five auto makers reported a 4.5 percent\nrise in sales volume last month, helped by higher exports. Hyundai's affiliate Kia Motors Corp. (000270.KS), the\ncountry's No. 2 auto maker, said it aimed to sell 1.54 million\nvehicles in 2007, up 22.1 percent from 2006. It targets 22\ntrillion won in revenue, up 15.8 percent. Neither company provided profit forecasts and officials\nfrom the auto makers declined to comment on profits. Hyundai Motor group, which includes affiliates such as\nHyundai Steel Co. (004020.KS) and parts maker Hyundai Mobis Co.\n(012330.KS), aims to increase its group-wide sales by 14\npercent to 106 trillion won, with exports of $40.1 billion. Shares in Hyundai rose 0.15 percent to 67,500 won compared\nwith a 0.06 percent gain in the broader market .KS11. Kia was\nup 0.4 percent up at 13,500 won. Hit by weaker profits, shares in Hyundai fell 30.7 percent\nin all of 2006, lagging the wider market's .KS11 4 percent\ngain. Kia shares dropped 49.3 percent last year.

Both groups were followed into young adulthood, up to an average age of 29.Children who were physically abused, neglected or both had as much as a 75 percent higher risk of suffering major depression as adults.\"In addition, these findings reveal that onset of depression began in childhood for many of the children,\" the report said.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-abuse-depression-idUSN2924492920070102", "sectors": [["Health"]], "title": "physical abuse leads to adult depression : study"},
{"date": "20:18 29 December 2006 (UTC)", "text": "WASHINGTON AT&T Inc. closed its $86 billion \npurchase of BellSouth Corp. on Friday after getting final \nregulatory approval, in a deal that will widen its lead in U.S. \nphone and Internet services. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission voted 4-0 to \napprove the deal after AT&T promised to maintain \"network \nneutrality\" of its high-speed Internet platform for two years, \nmeaning it will not charge certain Web media providers more to \ncarry data-heavy Internet content such as video. It was one of several key concessions that the top U.S. \nphone provider pledged late on Thursday to quiet concerns that \nthe takeover would stifle competition. Some investors had begun \nto expect a delay into 2007 as talks with the FCC dragged on. The San Antonio, Texas-based company also reaffirmed \nforecasts it gave when the merger was announced in March, \nsaying it expected total cost savings of $18 billion from the \ndeal, with $2 billion of that coming in 2008. Shares in AT&T rose 28 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $36.03 in \nafter-hours trading. Since hitting a trough in mid-May, AT&T \nshares have climbed more than 40 percent and closed at $35.75 \non the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. AT&T, which dates back more than 125 years to the invention \nof the telephone, has been trying to bolster its bottom line \nthrough acquisitions and expand into the television business as \nprofits from traditional phone service have waned. The company was formed in 2005 when local phone carrier SBC \nCommunications Inc. acquired AT&T and kept that name. Now four of the seven companies that were spun off from the \noriginal AT&T in 1984 are back under one roof, and it includes \n66.1 million telephone lines, 58.7 million Cingular Wireless \ncustomers and 11.6 million high-speed Internet customers. That clout is viewed as key to profitability in a \nconsolidating telecoms industry, as everyone from cable \noperators to Internet phone companies offer combined voice, \nvideo and Web services. AT&T's concession on net neutrality was of particular note \nbecause it had strenuously objected to any restriction on how \nit charged for services. The provision was praised by the FCC's two Democratic \ncommissioners and criticized by Chairman Kevin Martin and \nCommissioner Deborah Taylor Tate. \"Today's order does not mean that the commission has \nadopted an additional net neutrality principle,\" the two \nRepublicans said in a joint statement. \"We continue to believe such a requirement is not necessary \nand may impede infrastructure deployment,\" they said. \"Thus, \nalthough AT&T may make a voluntary business decision, it cannot \ndictate or bind government policy.\"\n CONCESSIONS ON INTERNET, WHOLESALE RATES A new legislative push to require net neutrality is \nexpected in 2007 from Rep. Edward Markey, the top Democrat on \nthe House subcommittee on telecommunications. In a statement, \nMarkey said the AT&T concession would be an \"important \nkeystone\" for future legislation. To win FCC approval, AT&T agreed to offer Internet access \nfor $10 a month and broadband for $19.95 per month. It also \nagreed to freeze prices and to price caps for some wholesale \nrates to give competitors access to its network for 48 months, \nlonger than an initial offer of 30 months. Rivals had complained that the initial conditions would \nundermine competition, particularly for high-speed Internet \nservice. They advocated restrictions lasting several years. By buying Atlanta, Georgia-based BellSouth, AT&T gets a \nfoothold in the southeastern United States. \"Moving forward, AT&T will work to integrate these services \nfor customers in the southeast, across the country and around \nthe world,\" said AT&T Chief Executive Ed Whitacre, who will be \nchairman and CEO of the combined company. AT&T's closest rival is Verizon Communications Inc. with \nalmost 46 million access lines, 56.7 million wireless \nsubscribers, and 6.6 million broadband customers. That company \nis also moving into the television business. Cable TV provider Comcast Corp. has about 11 million \nbroadband subscribers and 2.1 million voice customers. AT&T said it would repatriate 3,000 jobs outsourced by \nBellSouth, but did not give details or say how that would \naffect its expectation, announced in March, that the deal would \nresult in 10,000 job cuts by 2009.

{"date": "01:57 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "CANBERRA Aborigines won a 10-year fight for control of World Heritage-listed rainforests in the center of Australia's wealthy east coast on Tuesday, sealing one of the country's biggest native land deals.The Githabul people will help manage 19 national parks and state forests covering 6,000 square km (3,700 square miles) in New South Wales (NSW) state, including rugged mountain peaks said to be home to powerful ancestral spirits.The area lies beside some of Australia's most pristine coastal scenery, including the hip Byron Bay resort and the touristy beaches and cities of southern Queensland. Most of the country's economic wealth is concentrated along the eastern seaboard.\"They are no longer 'poor-bugger-me' blacks, but they will be standing on their country. The pride of that community is going to change,\" Warren Mundine, the chief executive of NSW Native Title Services which funded the claim, told Reuters.Many of Australia's 460,000 Aborigines live in remote communities with poor access to jobs, good housing, health services and education. They account for around 2.3 percent of the 20 million population.But Australia's High Court ruled in 1992 that Aborigines had a right to ancestral lands used prior to white settlement.A lower court awarded a native land claim over metropolitan Perth in Western Australia state last September, a decision that is being appealed by both the state and national governments.Prime Minister John Howard's conservative government has often clashed with Aboriginal leaders, favoring practical measures such as better access to health and education to symbolic land rights or an apology for past racial injustices.The Githabul deal follows a decade of talks and legal argument with the NSW government, and will allow around 250 tribal members to hunt and fish for protected native animals, including turtles and echidnas, or native ant-eaters.The claim covers the world heritage Border Ranges and Toonumbar national parks. Tribal elders hope it will also lead to jobs and less welfare dependency among local Aboriginals.\"Everyone usually thinks of native title and Aboriginal culture being in the north, but now here you've got it right in the heartland of the some of the wealthiest land in the country,\" Mundine said.He said talks were still under way over a second claim taking in parts of southern Queensland.Githabul claimant Trevor Close said the agreement would allow his \"people of the rainforest\" to hunt, fish and run businesses near the parks without fear of punishment.\"The claim was lodged because our boys were sick of being pulled up (by police and park authorities) for doing what they had always done,\" Close told local newspapers.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-australia-aborigines-idUSSYD14281120070102", "sectors": [["World"]], "title": "australian aborigines win east coast land claim"},

{"date": "02:29 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "LOS ANGELES (Billboard) - If 2006 was the year of user-generated content, 2007 will be the year the music industry learns to generate new revenue from the hugely popular trend.Labels are striking licensing deals with sites like YouTube so that fans can post copyrighted content or include it in videos they make themselves. Additionally, labels are expected to start releasing new types of content -- such as unused clips or video montages -- specifically created for fans to manipulate in new ways.By doing so, record labels can then share in the advertising revenue these sites collect. Rather than just suing YouTube and its ilk for how their sites are used, the music industry can now profit from them, not to mention reap the promotional benefits.\"They're doing it anyway,\" says Ted Cohen, former EMI Music Group digital executive and now founding partner of consulting firm TAG Strategic. \"There's a chance to monetize this behavior.\"Additionally, music companies have the chance to let their fans actually sell music to one another via playlist-sharing services and peer-recommendation sites. Word-of-mouth marketing is exploding online through user-generated activity, creating a new generation of tastemakers. How well labels tap this effective source of music discovery will be a barometer of their overall digital strategies.Here are five technologies shaping this space:SNOCAPLaunched with much fanfare in 2005, SnoCap has generated little momentum to date. But after scoring a big win with MySpace, which selected it to power its digital music service, 2007 could be SnoCap's year. The company's audio fingerprinting technologies -- as well as those from Audible Magic and Gracenote -- will play a key role in monetizing user-generated content by shifting the burden of acquiring licenses for copyrighted works from the end user to the service provider. Each time a fan uploads a copyrighted track, for whatever purpose, the technology notes who owns the rights, which ad is on the page hosting the content and how much the service provider is then owed.BRIGHTCOVEAnother method of monetizing existing behavior, Brightcove works with content owners like Warner Music Group to make videoclips available to fans wishing to post content on their blog or Web site. Its embedded video technology then tracks how many times a given clip is viewed and compensates rights holders via its advertising platform. With broadband now in 80% of U.S. Internet households, analysts expect video to be the most important form of online media next year.VENICE PROJECTAnalyst group In-Stat predicts that the Venice Project's peer-to-peer video project will be \"the big viral media sensation of 2007.\" Founded by the brains behind Kazaa and Skype -- Janus Friis and Niklas Zennstrom -- the service uses P2P technology to distribute video a la BitTorrent, but also lets users modify the content within the rules that copyright holders set in advance. Unlike Kazaa, the Venice Project is built from the get-go with a business model and respect for copyrights, and already has attracted Paramount Pictures, MTV Networks, Twentieth Century Fox Film and Warner Bros. Home Entertainment to the fold.ILIKEiLike is one of several taste-matching sites designed to offer music recommendations by comparing the musical preferences of members and matching those with similar interests. The sites' social-networking aspect provides a human element to counter competitors that rely too heavily on algorithms, and iLike's integration of Apple's iTunes music service sets it apart from the pack. None of these music-discovery services -- others include Last.fm, MOG and Mercora -- actually sell music themselves, instead linking to other services and often not taking a cut. But Ticketmaster's mid-December 25% investment in iLike illustrates how digital retailers and other music interests will seek to either partner or acquire such sites to better-link the discovery process with a sale.PASSALONGPeer-retailing services like PassAlong reward users for the sale of each digital track they recommend to friends. So far such services haven't been a big hit. But PassAlong's answer has been to branch out with applications like OnTour, which notify users when any artist in their digital music library is scheduled to appear in their town. As more social networks follow MySpace's lead and enter the digital music retail game, peer retailers like PassAlong, Weedshare and Peer Impact will become ripe for acquisition.Reuters/Billboard", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-tech-idUSN0126671420070102", "sectors": [["Entertainment, ", "Tech, ", "Music"]], "title": "music biz hopes to profit from consumer content"},

{"date": "02:33 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "NEW YORK The Washington Post Co. plans to have its veteran editors help shape the way stories appear on the Web in the latest example of how top U.S. publishers are retooling news operations for the Internet.The Washington Post's Web site, launched more than a decade ago, has been a bellwether among online news publishers because of its early success at attracting readers online and growing advertising.While many newspapers beef up their Internet sites to meet a growing migration of readership to the Web, their print and Web production operations remain mostly separate divisions.The Post for example produces and packages its Web news with employees who work across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., in Arlington, Virginia.Starting in January, print editors will \"help us at the Web site and at the paper think smartly about more three-dimensional ways that you can present that news,\" Post Executive Editor Leonard Downie Jr. told Reuters.Newspaper editors have traditionally focused on assigning and editing articles, as well as questions of layout, such as where a story sits on a print page, the tenor and size of its headline or its relation to a photograph.Web news also requires expertise in updating breaking stories through the day, drawing attention to human interest or feature stories as well as ensuring reporters make it a priority to add video, audio or commentary to the page.That integration is key to the future of newspapers, as Internet advertising is often their fastest growing segment, rising 30 to 60 percent annually, depending on the publisher, even as print ad rates and circulation declines.\"The majority of their audience is now online,\" said Jeff Jarvis, media consultant and publisher of the Buzzmachine blog. \"They have to serve that audience where that audience is.\"Some have cut hundreds of jobs, narrowed their print page width or consolidated production plants to save costs. Others face shareholder pressure to improve returns or sell assets.NEW ROLE FOR NEWSROOMSIn the meantime, many newspaper stocks are sharply underperforming the wider market as the pace of Internet earnings has yet to compensate for slower print growth.Washington Post stock has dropped 1.1 percent since the start of 2006, the New York Times has lost 10.4 percent and McClatchy Co. has shed nearly 27 percent, compared with a 14 percent rise in the benchmark S&P 500 Index.Companies aiming to bridge the gap with their own Web operations include USA Today publisher Gannett Co. Inc., which is reshaping newsrooms at nearly 90 local papers to emphasize Web and print news editions as equally important.More publishers anticipate similar changes to their operations, trying to push sometimes reluctant print staff to outline how they will do their jobs in the future.Dow Jones & Co. is relying on its Dow Jones Newswires service for much of its daily coverage, focusing on exclusive stories and analysis for its Wall Street Journal newspaper. The New York Times last year said it would integrate its Web and print operations.\"All of the desks here to varying degrees are becoming much more active about ... advising their reporters to call in to the continuous news desk or file their stories to us,\" said Neil Chase, editor at the Times' continuous news desk that assembles breaking news throughout the day.The Post has a similar division whose reporters and editors handle breaking stories for the Web, but that thinking has not penetrated to all levels of the print edition.\"The news section sometimes can use the continuous news desk as a crutch rather than finding ways themselves to make that news happen,\" said Washingtonpost.com editor Liz Spayd, former assistant managing editor of the paper's national news desk.The ideal, she said, would be for section editors to approach their jobs as, \"I'm not going to just think about like how it happens on the paper, but on the Web and every platform.\"She said the role of newspaper editors in building Web news will not take responsibility away from current Internet staff.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-washingtonpost-web-idUSN2925910120070102", "sectors": [["Tech"]], "title": "washington post aims for closer print , web ties"},
{"date": "01:23 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "BEIJING Jan 2 Exports by China's Chery\nAutomobile Co. rose 178 percent to 50,000 cars last year, the\nXinhua news agency reported on Tuesday, citing company sources. The company's overall car sales climbed 61 percent to 305,236\nin 2006, following a 118 percent sales surge in 2005, the report\nsaid. China has set a goal of taking exports from its fast-growing\nauto industry into developed markets, including the United\nStates. Late last year, the company based in Wuhu, in the eastern\nAnhui province, signed a deal with DaimlerChrysler AG's\nDCXGn.DE Chrysler Group for the Chinese manufacturer to build\nsmall cars in the Chrysler Group brands to be sold around the\nworld.In October, Chery signed a memorandum of understanding with\nItaly's Fiat Auto to supply the Italian maker 100,000 gasoline\nengines for cars produced both in China and abroad.Chery executives have said the company was considering an\ninitial public offering to raise money to fund its expansion. The\nXinhua report said Chery planned an IPO in 2008, possibly\nchoosing both the mainland A-share market and the Hong Kong\nmarket.\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/chery-exports-idUST14406220070102", "sectors": [], "title": "china ' s chery 2006 exports up 178 pct to 50 , 000 - report"},
{"date": "02:40 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "BANGKOK Thailand's military-installed government blamed former politicians on Monday for a series of bombs that killed three people in Bangkok, wounded 38, including nine foreigners, and ruined New Year celebrations.Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont said intelligence pointed to politicians who had lost power, not Muslim militants waging a separatist insurgency in the far south, but admitted the government did not know who was responsible.Surayud declined to say what evidence pointed to former politicians less than five months after a bloodless coup ousted twice-elected Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, whose supporters he said might have been involved.The government ruled out any foreign hand in the unprecedented attacks in the Thai capital.\"We could not at this stage pinpoint which particular group was involved,\" said Surayud, installed after the September 19 coup.\"Briefs from various intelligence agencies, based on evidence available, show that they came from groups that have lost political powers,\" he told a news conference as police and soldiers mounted a major security operation.\"These were not just the previous government, but include all those which have lost power in the past,\" he added.Thaksin's lawyer called the implications a \"smear campaign\" by the government, which has refused to allow his client to return home to defend himself against corruption allegations.Australia said it feared more attacks and joined Britain and the United States in urging their citizens to stay indoors.Involvement of Muslim militants, whose insurgency has cost more than 1,800 lives over the past three years but has remained confined to the far south, was a \"very remote possibility\", Surayud said.TIGHT SECURITYCoup leader General Sonthi Boonyaratglin, Thailand's first Muslim army chief who cut short his Haj and returned to Bangkok on Monday, ruled out any links to foreign terrorist groups such as al Qaeda.Security analyst Panitan Wattanayagorn said the bombings appeared to be locally planned and politically motivated, perhaps by those facing corruption probes by the post-coup government.\"Their aim may be to destabilize the government to make sure the accusations against them are dropped or negotiated,\" the Chulalongkorn University lecturer told Reuters.Since Thaksin was ousted and his administration scrutinized by graft busters, several schools have been torched outside Bangkok and martial law kept in several areas because of what the army calls \"undercurrents\".But leading members of billionaire Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais) party have denied it is involved in any form of violent resistance to the coup.Thaksin's lawyer, Noppadon Pattama, said the former leader, believed to be in China, was the victim of \"baseless accusations, a smear campaign\".Police and soldiers set up 6,000 checkpoints across the city of nine million people and its suburbs after what deputy national police chief General Achiravit Supanpasat said was the worst attack in Bangkok in his 40-year career.Police with sniffer dogs patrolled stations on the urban mass transit system.\"I feel fear,\" said 45-year-old train commuter Sinjai, who went to work but told her family to stay home.\"I'm not confident in the government's security system.\"All eight of the small New Year's Eve time-bombs were made of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and triggered by digital watches.Some were planted in areas likely to cause deaths -- outside a shopping mall, in an open-air market -- and some were not, like one in the parking lot of another mall. But two later bombs which exploded around midnight would have caused untold mayhem had New Year street parties gone ahead.They were planted at either end of the broad stretch of road in Bangkok's upscale shopping district where the main party was to have been held.Nine foreigners were among the wounded -- four Hungarians, three Serbs and two Britons, police said.With an eye on Thailand's lucrative tourist trade, which lures around 12 million visitors each year, Achiravit said his men would ensure the streets are safe. \"We are the police. We know who is good or bad by looking,\" he said.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-thailand-bombs-idUSBKK14460620070102", "sectors": [["World"]], "title": "thai pm blames ex - politicians for bombs"},
{"date": "02:40 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "BANGKOK Whoever was behind Bangkok's New Year's Eve bombings sent a clear message to Thailand's army-appointed government: terrorism can also be a political tool and 2007 will not be an easy year.The six bombs that exploded hours before midnight and two that went off as 2007 arrived, killing three and wounding 38, also served to remind the generals that exercising power is far more difficult than seizing it.\"They are beginning to wake up to quite how difficult the task they have set themselves is, if you fling out a political leader who has support of 55 percent of the country,\" said political analyst and Thaksin biographer Chris Baker.Since pulling off his bloodless September 19 coup against twice-elected Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, little has gone right for army chief Sonthi Boonyaratglin, and his former commanding officer, Surayud Chulanont, who was appointed interim premier after Thailand's 18th military putsch in 74 years.The Council for National Security (CNS), as the coup leaders now call themselves, has struggled to dredge up concrete evidence against Thaksin of corruption -- the primary motive in removing the billionaire from office.In the Malay-speaking far south, Surayud's overtures to Muslim militants behind a three-year separatist insurgency were met by immediate spikes in violence.Then, just as events were winding down for the end-of-year holiday season, the central bank and army-appointed finance minister sent markets into a tail-spin with draconian currency controls designed to stop the baht rising against the dollar.Analysts expect the stock market, the worst performer in Asia in 2006, to fall as much four percent in reaction to the bombings when it reopens after the New Year break on Wednesday.With the media rediscovering its bite after three months of acquiescence, the Nation newspaper had fortune-tellers predicting political chaos, including major anti-CNS street protests and postponement of the elections promised under a new constitution by October.TROUBLE LOOKING LIKELYA day after the bombs, Surayud acknowledged they were an attempt to \"create political insecurity among the public\" but his vague explanations as to who was behind them begged more questions than answers.As well as blaming elements within Thaksin's ousted administration, he also pointed the finger at \"all those which have lost power in the past\".His failure to elaborate provided more grist to a rumor mill already working overtime thanks to the confusion of messages coming out of the army, police and government.Among the theories in newspapers on Tuesday were southern militants taking their campaign to the capital, which they have not done so far and which would mark a dramatic escalation of their struggle.Others had police seeking to head off an army-imposed reform drive, a renegade former prime minister acting in a fit of pique and or hardline elements in the army looking for excuses to continue military rule.Historically, the army's approach to domestic security has relied primarily on suppression, and with martial law still officially in place, there is no reason to see why it should be any different now, analysts said.In that case, some sort of re-run of the bloody \"Black May\" clashes in 1992 between troops and pro-democracy demonstrators that followed Thailand's last military coup a year earlier is a realistic possibility, they said.\"Their instincts are all about suppression, and I think that is the way they will go. But they risk putting themselves in silly situations, dangerous situations, and it will erode whatever minute legitimacy they have,\" Baker said.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-thailand-idUSBKK13121220070102", "sectors": [["World"]], "title": "thai new year bombs send grim message to junta"},

As the new year kicks off, Billboard queried executives and \nindustry observers in the United States and Latin America to \ncome up with a list of acts with a good chance of succeeding \nbeyond their borders in the first quarter.\n VALERIA GASTALDI (ARGENTINA) Gastaldi comes from Bandana, a reality-show-spawned girl \ngroup which became an Argentine phenomenon between 2002 and \n2003, selling almost 500,000 copies. In her debut, slated for \nMay, Gastaldi pens her own songs and works with Latin \nGrammy-winning producer Cachorro Lopez.\n PAPAS DA LINGUA (BRAZIL) This witty 13-year-old pop-rock band had a loyal following \nlimited mostly to the south of Brazil. But then its CD/DVD \n\"Papas da Lingua ao Vivo Acustico\" was picked up by EMI, and \nthe track \"Eu Sei\" was featured in the soap opera \"Paginas da \nVida.\" In December, the track was No. 1 on Brazil's radio \ncharts, paving the way for a surge in 2007.\n KUDAI (CHILE) Chile, long without a major international success, now has \nco-ed quartet Kudai, who have sold more than 120,000 copies in \nLatin America. A sophomore album, \"Vuelve,\" was released last \nfall in Chile and Argentina and will hit Colombia, Mexico and \nthe United States this spring. An MTV Latin America award for \nbest pop artist as well as a theme song on MTV show \"Quiero Mis \nQuinces\" should propel sales.\n ANDRES CEPEDA (COLOMBIA) Big in Colombia with his mix of boleros, ballads and world \nbeats, the endearing Cepeda has never broken ground here. \nGeorge Zamora, the president of his La Calle Records label, \nsays he's committed to doing that in the first quarter, \nreworking his single \"Para Amarte Mejor,\" from his 2006 \nself-titled album.\n MIGUEL & BERNIE (DOMINICAN REPUBLIC) New York-based J&N Records is home to a slew of successful \ntropical acts. Now, president Juan Hidalgo is psyched about \nbachata duo Miguel & Bernie, whom he singles out for their \ndistinctive vocal timbre and songwriting skills; the siblings \nhave penned tracks for the likes of Frank Reyes and Monchy & \nAlexandra. Their debut album is due in the first quarter.\n YURIDIA (MEXICO) An unassuming girl with a glorious voice, Yuridia is the \ntop-selling alumna of TV reality show \"La Academia,\" having \nmoved nearly 1 million albums in Mexico alone. She has yet to \ndo promotion in the United States, but early sales point to \nhuge possibilities. A newly released album of international pop \ncovers, \"Habla el Corazon,\" paves the way for a disc of \npreviously unreleased material later in 2007.\n LA SISTA (PUERTO RICO) Forget sexy reggaeton chicks in micro-shorts. Reggaeton act \nLa Sista is short, chubby and proud to exult in her African \nroots, which she plays up on her newly released debut, \n\"Majestad Negroide.\"\n RAFA VERGARA (SPAIN) After writing songs for countless acts, including David \nBisbal, Rafa Vergara gets his turn.

Instead he has been treated as a criminal by authorities as he has no legal right to stay in the forests where his forefathers lived and died.\"It is the eviction notices from the government and rules made to uproot us by the forest officials that give us sleepless nights,\" said Daya, who belongs to the 8,400-strong Maldhari tribe of Gir.Over 40 million of India's most impoverished and marginalized people live in the country's forests -- including tiger reserves, wildlife sanctuaries and national parks -- but for years have been neglected by the government and left to fend for themselves.The Maldharis have long lived with eviction threats, alleged harassment and extortion by officials who say they are guilty of environmental destruction and endangering wildlife in the sanctuary -- one of the last bastions of the rare Asiatic lion.But a new law will for the first time enshrine their right to live in the forests and national parks. Conservationists are worried this could hamper efforts to save India's endangered wildlife such as lions and tigers.IMPOVERISHED AND FORGOTTENIn Gir, the pastoral Maldhari community live a simple life in small mud houses hidden deep in the forests, with no electricity, running water, schools or access to healthcare.They earn a living by producing milk from their cattle, growing vegetables, collecting honey and trading their produce in the local market for items like food grains. Most are illiterate and unable to count or use money.Activists say these forgotten forest people lead a primitive life and face many hardships.\"The pastoral communities do not figure in the electoral rolls,\" said Shekla Rakha from Setu -- a charity promoting the rights of forest dwellers. \"They have become non-entities, left to fend for themselves for generations.\"As a result, activists say these communities are vulnerable to exploitation allegedly by forest officials who forcefully evict them or compel them to pay bribes to enter and exit sanctuaries.\"Two months ago when my mother died, the forest officials did not allow my relatives from nearby villages to enter the forest for the last rites,\" Amra Suba, a shepherd said as he tended to his flock of sheep.\"I had to pay to get permission for their entry to my own house.\"But the Recognition of Forest Rights Bill 2006, passed by parliament in December, could help end the suffering of many of India's forest people by giving them rights over forest land.The law, which will apply to those who have lived in the forests for at least three generations, will allow dwellers to use non-timber forest produce such as bamboo, stumps, cane and to collect honey. But it prohibits them from hunting animals.PROTECTORS OR DESTROYERS?While this is seen as a landmark law by social activists, environmentalists and forestry officials who hold forest dwellers responsible for damaging the environment and poaching wild animals, are concerned.\"If allowed to live in the forest, they will degrade the habitat as their cattle graze in direct competition with prey like deer,\" said Bharat Pathak, conservator of Gir's forests, referring to how a fall in prey would hurt numbers of predators.Livestock are also prone to epidemics and could infect Gir's wildlife which includes the rare Asiatic lion whose numbers have recovered to around 360 from less than 15 in the mid-20th century due to a successful breeding project, he added.Conservationists are also concerned that the law will allow more encroachers into the forests and push wildlife out of protected areas, leaving them more vulnerable to hunters.Some wildlife activists say it is essential that forest dwellers be involved in conservation efforts and given a sense of ownership and responsibility over the forests, perhaps by employing them as tourist guides or forest guards.Forest dwellers say they are not responsible for the loss of wildlife and regularly report poaching to authorities and monitor illegal activities such as mining and tree felling. \"Officials say we are eating up the forest but in reality we are helping in protecting the lions and the jungle,\" says Lali Rudha, a mother of seven children.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-india-forests-idUSDEL25463820070102", "sectors": [["Science"]], "title": "india ' s forgotten tribes gain rights over forests"},

{"date": "02:30 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " (Updates comments by analysts, details, closing prices) By Faith Hung TAIPEI, Jan 2 Taishin (2887.TW), Taiwan's No. 2\nfinancial holding firm, said on Tuesday it would book a T$9.7\nbillion (US$298 million) loss in 2006 from the sale of bad debt,\nsending its stock to a six-month high on investor hopes the firm\nwould recover from its worst year ever. The board of Taishin, whose foreign investors include private\nequity fund Newbridge Capital [NB.UL] and a fund managed by\nbillionaire George Soros, approved the loss to be booked in its\n2006 financial statements, according to a company statement. The move would pave the way for an improvement in its asset\nquality because Taishin had earlier planned to book the loss over\nthe next five years, some analysts said. \"This is a very positive step. It helps ensure common\nshareholders like Soros would receive dividends in 2007,\" said\nanalyst Nora Hou of Nomura Securities, which has a target price\nof T$24 on Taishin stock. The move also bodes well for Taishin's merger with Chang Hwa\nBank (2801.TW), a state-run lender in which Taishin has a 25\npercent stake. \"Taishin can get better terms when it negotiates with the\ngovernment about the stock swap ratio with Chang Hwa,\" Hou said,\nadding that the merger could be completed sooner, in the first\nhalf of this year rather than the second half.\n But some other analysts were less optimistic. \"The surge of Taishin stock today is probably getting\nspeculative,\" said Dexter Hsu, an analyst for JP Morgan. \"The merger's synergy would not kick in for at least another\nyear, since Taishin has to go through a painful process to\nintegrate Chang Hwa,\" Hsu said. TURNING AROUND Taishin also planned to raise up to T$17 billion by selling a\nsubordinate bond in the first quarter as Taishin seeks to improve\nits financial health, the statement said. Taishin would turn profitable with a net profit of T$11.5\nbillion in 2007, some analysts said. Taishin was forecast to have\na full-year loss of T$14.7 billion in 2006, marking its worst\nyear since it was established in 2002. Taishin had said it sold a 4.67 percent stake at T$15 per\nshare to QE International, a subsidiary of Soros' Quantum\nPartners LDC in a T$4 billion deal. On Tuesday, share of Taishin soared by the daily 7-percent\nlimit to close at T$20.40, its highest level since June, and was\nthe sixth most actively traded issue by volume. The jump means a 36 percent quick paper profit for Soros'\ninvestment in less than two weeks. Taishin stock beat both the main stock index .TWII and the\nfinancial sub-index .TFNI, which rose 1.24 percent and 2.58\npercent, respectively. For the first nine months last year, the company had a T$4.84\nbillion net loss.Taishin and its peers suffered the losses after extending too\nmuch credit to consumers who failed to pay the money back.\n(US$1=T$32.48)\n\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/taishin-taiwan-idUSTP18138920070102", "sectors": [], "title": "update 1 - taiwan taishin says to book loss , stock jumps"},
{"date": "03:16 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "SEOUL Top South Korean auto maker Hyundai Motor Co. (005380.KS) said on Tuesday it expected global revenue growth to more than double in 2007, boosted by higher sales abroad and increase in sales of high-end models.The world's No. 6 carmaker, also announcing a small fall in December 2006 car sales volume, said it expected revenue to jump by 13.5 percent to 42 trillion won ($45 billion) after it rose 5.7 percent in 2006.Hyundai envisages a brighter year in 2007 after it saw profits last year squeezed by losses from labor unrest and stronger won currency KRW=.Growth in overall sales at Hyundai is expected to accelerate this year, fueled by healthy overseas sales of premium cars recently launched including the Santa Fe sport utility vehicle (SUV), analysts said.\"Hyundai is expected to accomplish the target as productions at home and abroad will be able to meet demand abroad,\" said Yong Dae-in, an auto analyst at Goodmorning Shinhan Securities.Hyundai Motor's global sales rose to 37 trillion won in 2006 from 35 trillion in 2005, a Hyundai official said.The 2007 revenue forecast includes sales at Hyundai's overseas units. Sales from its South Korean based production units only are expected to rise 7.3 percent this year to about 31 trillion won, according to analysts polled by Reuters Estimates.But some analysts said Hyundai's sales target was too aggressive as local sales were seen under pressure amid sluggish domestic demand in Asia's third-largest economy and lack of new models.\"There is no room for Hyundai's sales to increase as Hyundai does not have a specific new model to boost sales and as consumer sentiment is still weak,\" said Choi Dae-sik, an analyst at CJ Investment Securities.Hyundai aims to sell 2.735 million vehicles in 2007, up 9.4 percent from 2.501 million sold last year.\"We will meet the target by growth in overseas sales as we plan to ship the Veracruz SUV to the U.S. in March and to launch the 'FD' in May,\" Jake Jang, a Hyundai spokesman said, referring a compact model for the European market.\"We also aim to increase sales at home with aggressive marketing although domestic consumption has not revived yet,\" he added.In December 2006, Hyundai sold 247,254 vehicles, 1.5 percent lower than a year ago when South Korea's customers rushed to show rooms for new cars before a tax benefit expired.But South Korea's five auto makers reported a 4.5 percent rise in sales volume last month, helped by higher exports.Hyundai's affiliate Kia Motors Corp. (000270.KS), the country's No. 2 auto maker, said it aimed to sell 1.54 million vehicles in 2007, up 22.1 percent from 2006. It targets 22 trillion won in revenue, up 15.8 percent.Neither company provided profit forecasts and officials from the auto makers declined to comment on profits.Hyundai Motor group, which includes affiliates such as Hyundai Steel Co. (004020.KS) and parts maker Hyundai Mobis Co. (012330.KS), aims to increase its group-wide sales by 14 percent to 106 trillion won, with exports of $40.1 billion.Shares in Hyundai rose 0.15 percent to 67,500 won compared with a 0.06 percent gain in the broader market .KS11. Kia was up 0.4 percent up at 13,500 won.Hit by weaker profits, shares in Hyundai fell 30.7 percent in all of 2006, lagging the wider market's .KS11 4 percent gain. Kia shares dropped 49.3 percent last year.($1=929.5 Won)(Additional reporting by Rhee So-eui and Jang Se-ra)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-hyundaimotor-sales-idUSSEO13893220070102", "sectors": [], "title": "hyundai targets 2007 revenue growth spurt"},

{"date": "03:31 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "BANGKOK The unprecedented New Year's Eve bombs in central Bangkok shattered the festive mood of revelers and the high hopes for 2007 of Thailand's key tourism industry, tour operators and economists said on Tuesday.\"This is a big shock, hitting us at the peak of our high season when tourists, especially Europeans, are pouring in,\" said Suparuak Surangkura, president of NS Travel and Tours, a Bangkok-based operator for European and Asian tourists.No one has claimed responsibility for the eight bombs that killed three Thais and wounded nine foreign holidaymakers when they exploded in central Bangkok on New Year's Eve.Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont, appointed after a September 19 coup against Thaksin Shinawatra, has pointed the finger at politicians \"who had lost power,\" but said that did not mean exclusively Thaksin's ousted administration.Australia, the United States and Britain quickly issued travel advisories, urging their citizens to avoid all public gatherings and to remain extra vigilant in the sprawling capital of nine million.On the Khao San Road, Bangkok's famed backpacker travel hub, most tourists were taking events in their stride.\"We've had bombs in London and you've just got to carry on as usual,\" said 32-year-old Kate Perry from Brighton in southern England.However, some complained that the extra security imposed after the bombs forced the cancellation of New Year's Eve street parties was putting a dampener on the perennial party spirit and causing bars to close early.\"There are lots of police now and it feels kind of uncomfortable,\" said Kevin Ostrowski, 23, from Vancouver. \"But hopefully it will all die down and Bangkok will become fun again.\"SUN-SOAKED BEACHESAfter SARS, the Indian Ocean tsunami and bird flu in the last few years, Thailand's tourism industry, which attracts 12 million visitors a year and accounts for 6 percent of gross domestic product, was hoping for a golden year.But tour operators said foreign travel warnings would make it difficult to hit the growth target of 10-12 percent for 2007.\"Advisories of various countries to avoid Thailand are quite damaging as tour groups that ignore them do not get safety insurance coverage,\" said Apichart Sangka-aree of the Association of Thai Travel Agents, which speaks for 350 firms.The full extent of the impact would only become clear on Wednesday when tour operators reopened after the New Year break, he said, although if the blasts turned out to be a one off, the fallout would not be disastrous.Economists said an expected loss of revenue in an industry that raked in $13 billion in 2006 -- the fourth biggest foreign exchange earner after electronics, electrical appliances and cars -- could lead to annual growth at the bottom end of forecasts.Coming so soon after the central bank's disastrous imposition of capital controls in a bid to stem the baht's rise against the dollar, the effect could be even greater.\"The economy is getting a double-hit in less than a month,\" Somphob Manarangsan of Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University said.Singapore-based analyst Leslie Khoo of Forecast Pte, who cut GDP growth forecasts for 2007 to 4.0 percent after the capital controls were introduced in December, said the blasts and political instability only made the outlook less rosy.\"The bombings just increase the probability of the 4 percent growth forecast,\" he said.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-thailand-bombs-tourism-idUSBKK15166820070102", "sectors": [["World"]], "title": "bangkok bombs cast shadow over thai tourism"},

We hope that companies,\norganisations and other countries will follow,\" he said. Emissions by planes on international flights are excluded\nfrom the goals of the U.N.'s Kyoto Protocol, a plan that binds\n35 rich nations to cut emissions from burning oil, coal and\nnatural gas by five percent below 1990 levels by 2008-12. Stoltenberg did not say how much his plan would cost.\nNorway's NTB news agency estimated the cost at about $400,000 a\nyear. Most scientists say emissions from burning oil, coal and\nnatural gas are to blame for a global rise in temperatures that\nmay wreak havoc with the climate by causing more floods,\ndesertification, heatwaves, spreading disease and raising sea\nlevels. Some companies, including Norway's oil group Statoil,\nalready have similar policies of paying for emissions caused by\nemployees' flights.

{"date": "04:23 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "PARIS French presidential frontrunners Segolene Royal and Nicolas Sarkozy issued New Year greetings via the Internet on Monday in contrasting styles that spoke volumes about their different approach to the campaign.While Interior Minister Sarkozy offered a traditional message to welcome in 2007, Socialist candidate Royal appeared in an amateur-style video with none of the formal trappings normally associated with top-level French politics.Sarkozy and Royal are running neck and neck in opinion polls ahead of the first round of voting set for April 22, with each promising a clean break with the past.Sarkozy promotes himself as a stern defender of law and order, while Royal presents a more innovative image in her bid to become France's first female president.In her New Year's message, a relaxed Royal is seen wearing no make up, sitting in the corner of a white room, with a string of simple Christmas lights hanging from the wall.Sophisticated editing techniques make the three-minute message look like a cross between a homemade movie and a trendy TV commercial. In her speech, Royal makes no mention of her Socialist party and only indirectly refers to the elections.\"I want a new republic that serves its citizens, built in cooperation with the people and founded on everyday life,\" she says, selling herself as a down-to-earth leader close to the ordinary people.\"I'M COUNTING ON YOU\"By contrast, a somber-suited Sarkozy, stands in front of the symbol of his Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party for his Internet message, making a party political broadcast and accusing the Socialist party of lacking new ideas.\"France is not finished,\" he says, smiling broadly and fidgeting like a hyperactive child.\"Believe me, if France is happy, your families will be too. I'm counting on you, I need you.\"Sarkozy secured his party's nomination for the election on Sunday when he was the only person to put his name forward to claim the UMP candidature.However, his hopes of dominating the conservative vote could yet come unstuck, with President Jacques Chirac refusing to say whether he plans to seek an unprecedented third term.The president offered his own New Year greetings to France late on Sunday in an annual televised address where he spelt out what he said should be the main election issues and promising to play a full part in the forthcoming debate.Political analysts believe Chirac, who is languishing in the opinion polls after almost 12 years in power, is unlikely to seek re-election, but far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen said on Sunday he believed the veteran leader would spring a surprise.\"I think Jacques Chirac will be a candidate. He presented much more of a manifesto than a summary of his achievements (in his address),\" he told France Info radio.Chirac has never forgiven Sarkozy for siding with a rightist rival in the 1995 presidential election and, even if he decides not to run, he is unlikely to throw his weight fully behind the ambitious UMP leader.-- Royal's Internet message is posted on her Web site:here-- Sarkozy's message is at:www.u-m-p.org/site/index.php", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-france-elections-idUSL0178602420070102", "sectors": [["Tech"]], "title": "web wishes show contrasting french election styles"},

Local media reported at least 60 passengers were confirmed dead.\"The search and rescue efforts are focused on saving the living first. The search is concentrated on areas in East Java province until seven days after the accident date,\" Central Java province rescue coordinator Eko Prayitno told Reuters.He said high waves and strong sea currents were pushing the bodies of the dead and the living eastwards in the direction of Surabaya, the capital of East Java province and Indonesia's second largest city.On Monday, bad weather was also linked to the crash of a domestic commercial airliner on Sulawesi island, killing 90 people.Officials said dozens of the ferry passengers had been picked up by passing ships and rescuers were also trying to reach several life rafts with people on board.\"Because of the bad weather, SAR (Search and Rescue) is using a fixed-wing plane for searching, and a helicopter for dropping food,\" Prayitno told Reuters.He said in one area alone 30 survivors remain on life rafts.Tony Syaiful, a spokesman for the Indonesian navy, said 33 survivors had been found on Tuesday. Two corpses were also recovered.Strong winds and high seas continued to hamper rescue efforts, he said.SURVIVORS PICKED UPOne survivor, a 32-year-old man with badly injured legs who gave his name as Fadlan, recounted on Tuesday his escape from the sinking vessel.\"I broke the windows of the deck and jumped out. It was raining hard and the waves were high. For two days I floated clinging on to foam (from life buoys) before a fishing boat found me and transported me to a navy ship,\" he said, shortly after arriving in the Central Java port of Rembang.According to the manifest, the Senopati Nusantara ferry was carrying 628 people, including 57 crew.Transportation Minister Hatta Rajasa has said the Japanese-built, 2,178-ton ferry was seaworthy and had a capacity of more than 850 passengers.The ship had been heading from Kalimantan on Borneo island to Semarang. It was the second ferry disaster in the last week of 2006 after a vessel overturned on Thursday in rough seas off Sumatra. Two people on that ferry died and 26 were missing as of late Sunday, a rescue official said.Ships and ferries are a popular means of transport among Indonesia's 17,000 islands.

{"date": "04:34 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "WASHINGTON Back from a weeklong Texas vacation, President George W. Bush wrestles with a decision on a new strategy for Iraq in the face of hostile Democrats in control of Congress and signs of growing unhappiness among some military personnel.A day after the U.S. death toll in Iraq passed 3,000, the president and first lady Laura Bush arrived back in Washington on Monday afternoon from his Crawford, Texas, ranch. They stopped briefly at the White House before going to Capitol Hill where the body of former President Gerald R. Ford lay in state.But overtures of a storm to come over a strategy shift on Iraq already were present in a poll published by Military Times, a private newspaper. A questionnaire mailed to subscribers found just 35 percent of active-duty personnel approved of how Bush is handling Iraq and 42 percent disapproved.Although it is not affiliated with the military, the newspaper has a following among the armed services and the poll, prominently displayed on its Web site, was widely cited during the weekend. The newspaper said there was a 95 percent probability that the poll results are accurate within three percentage points.While at his ranch, Bush was joined by top administration advisers as they mulled how to cope with the more than 3-year-old Iraqi war, including whether escalating U.S. troop strength there might help quell the violence.Exactly when Bush may announce his new strategy, possibly in a national address, remains unclear. Some commentators speculate it could be within days -- before the January 23 State of the Union address -- and potentially include an increase of 15,000 to 30,000 combat troops, chiefly to try to end sectarian fighting and stop death squads in Baghdad.If so, it will trigger a fight in Congress where Democrats who take control of both the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate this week after winning majorities in November's congressional elections want a phased withdrawal of U.S. troops and not an increase.But wary of being tagged as wanting withdrawal regardless of consequences, the Democratic tactic more likely will be to lay out their case in high-profile hearings for shrinking U.S. forces in Iraq by highlighting the costs of the conflict in terms of dollars and lives.In a New Year's Day address, Bush showed no sign he was losing resolve, promising to \"remain on the offensive against the enemies of freedom, advance the security of our country, and work toward a free and unified Iraq.\"Even within his own Republican Party, however, some oppose amending Iraq strategy by introducing a \"surge\" or temporary increase in troop levels. A column by Robert Novak in Monday's Washington Post quoted Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska describing any such proposal as \"Alice in Wonderland.\"\"I'm absolutely opposed to sending any more troops to Iraq,\" Hagel said. \"It's folly.\"", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-usa-iraq-idUSN0126144620070102", "sectors": [["U.S., ", "Politics"]], "title": "holiday over , bush set to wrestle with iraq policy"},

{"date": "04:37 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "NEW YORK Here is a lesson in life-or-death economics: You are a kidnap victim in a third world country. Do you want rescuers to come in with guns blazing, or pay a ransom?Movie-style rescues work -- about half the time. The rest of the time, insurers say, the victim dies in a hail of bullets. When kidnappers are paid off, the odds of survival improve dramatically.David Lattin, who handles kidnap and extortion cases for St. Paul Travelers Companies Inc., said that in the 175 cases he has been involved in since 1991, only one person has been killed. And, even though he is a former lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Marines, he has never fired a gun in anger.The debate on force versus payoff has advocates on both sides. Both the United States and Israel have a blanket policy of refusing to negotiate with those it calls terrorists. Corporations, on the other hand, say their first responsibility is the safe return of the victim.Lattin doesn't debate the policies. He just works through them. \"We won't give advice that breaks the law, but when you present the statistics to the local authorities, they will likely allow you to negotiate,\" said the soft-spoken, bearded and bespectacled Lattin.Doesn't he encourage kidnappers by paying them off? \"Yes, if you pay them $10 million,\" Lattin says. But negotiation itself costs nothing.\"We use time and subtle resistance,\" he said. \"We say, 'Call me in a week.' We show that the company won't be an easy target.\"Kidnappers generally play along. Their victim is a resource, and the captors get nothing by killing. \"We assess their motivation,\" Lattin said. \"If it's money, we take them down that path.\"Sometimes it is not money. In 2004, a European executive disappeared from an airport in Bangladesh and was apparently being held illegally in a local jail. A story in a Singapore newspaper implying that Bangladesh was not a safe place to do business was enough to get him released immediately, Lattin said.ROUGH CIRCLESLattin is willing to make contacts even in the roughest of circles, and it has paid off. In 1992 he saw the head of an insurgency group signing autographs at an airport in Davao City in the Philippines. Lattin grabbed the same flight, sat down with the insurgent and got friendly. He even got the leader's autograph on a postcard, including a \"Dear David\" salutation.Later he handled a company facing extortion by the same insurgent group. He showed a copy of the card to the local union leader, who sent it to the group's top leadership. The extortion ended the same day, Lattin said.Sometimes the payment is small. When Haitian gunmen kidnapped two Canadians off the streets of Port-au-Prince, it took only a week to get them released. The thugs had demanded $2 million. They got $4,000. In another case, the kidnap ended when the abductors' manifesto was published in the local newspaper.Lattin said he always uses local talent to communicate with the abductors. In one case, a company in Mexico hired a former FBI agent from Puerto Rico who stumbled when translating the kidnappers' local slang. \"They contemptuously said, 'Who's the 'Rican?'\" Lattin recalled.The local communicator has a script for each contact with the kidnappers, and cannot deviate from it. The communicator also does not know the end game, such as how much the company might be willing to pay. The game can be played out over days, weeks, or even months.Lattin, 53, lives in Wallowa, Oregon, and spends a lot of time traveling, since a lead negotiator is required at the scene as well as one at corporate headquarters. In Rio de Janeiro abductions usually end in 48 hours; in Colombia they can last for nine months, he said.Despite eschewing a swashbuckler image, Lattin is well known in the industry and director Taylor Hackford asked him to review the script of his 2000 movie on kidnapping: \"Proof of Life,\" which stars Russell Crowe.Lattin said the script was accurate until the shootout at the end.\"That was pure Hollywood,\" he said.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-insurance-kidnap-idUSN1130230420070102", "sectors": [], "title": "in kidnapping , finesse works best"},

He did not say what the opposition had in mind.Opposition supporters have been camped out in central Beirut since December 1 to demand the anti-Syrian government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora step down. Hezbollah, a group backed by Damascus and Tehran, says the campaign will remain peaceful.\"The opposition forces will sit together and assess what happened in the last month ... study ideas proposed in the arena -- whether there are horizons for solutions or not,\" Kassem said in an interview with Hezbollah's al-Manar television station.\"Naturally, it has become clear that the horizons are not very open. Then (the opposition) will take a series of steps, actions,\" he said in the interview late on Monday.Many Lebanese fear the crisis could turn violent. One anti-government protester has already been killed.The protest has severely disrupted commercial life in downtown Beirut, where roads are closed and troops, armored vehicles and razor wire protect the government's headquarters.The opposition initially called for veto power in cabinet but has raised its demands to early parliamentary elections.It has declared as illegitimate Siniora's government, which came to office following the first parliamentary elections after the withdrawal of Syrian troops in 2005.CONCERNED ABOUT TRIBUNALThe anti-Syrian leaders who control government say the opposition is effectively trying to stage a coup which would lead to more Syrian and Iranian influence in Lebanon. Hezbollah says Siniora's cabinet answers to the U.S. government.Kassem accused the government of wrecking an initiative by Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa to end the crisis -- Lebanon's worst since its 1975-1990 civil war.\"The government factions believe time is on their side -- that the opposition will tire. We say to them today the opposition will not tire and is staying in the street.Anti-Syrian leaders say the opposition's real goal is to derail an international tribunal to try suspects in the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri.The anti-Syrian coalition believes Syrian-backed opposition groups want to shield Damascus from prosecution. Syria denies involvement in the February 14, 2005 killing -- the first in a series of assassinations of anti-Syrian figures.Kassem said Hezbollah was concerned the tribunal had a political slant that reflected U.S. designs. Washington, which brands Hezbollah a terrorist group, wanted the court formed quickly for its own purposes, he said.Anti-Syrian Druze leader Walid Jumblatt last week for the first time accused Hezbollah of being behind some of the assassinations, though his allies have not repeated the charge.Kassem reiterated Hezbollah's position that it supported the idea of the court but wanted to discuss the details.\"We are scared of politicization. Therefore we insist on discussion of the articles of the tribunal, one by one,\" he said.

{"date": "05:27 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "BAGHDAD U.S.-led forces are likely to launch a limited New Year offensive against Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi Army militia, blamed for sectarian death squad killings, senior Iraqi officials say.The Pentagon, in a report last month, described Mehdi Army militias as the biggest threat to Iraq's security and diplomats say Washington is impatient to confront them.Several officials in the Shi'ite political parties that dominate Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's unity government also say they are losing patience with Sadr's supporters and predict more raids like last week's joint U.S.-Iraqi operation in which a senior Sadr aide was killed.\"There will be limited and targeted operations against members of the Mehdi Army,\" a senior Shi'ite official told Reuters. \"The ground is full of surprises but we think around January 5 there will be some operations. I can say no more.\"British forces in the southern oil province of Basra have also been conducting major raids against groups they describe as \"rogue Mehdi Army,\" some entrenched in Iraqi police units.Last week, British troops blew up the headquarters of Basra's Major Crimes Unit and said they freed tortured prisoners.\"The Americans want a war with the Mehdi Army,\" said a Western diplomat in Baghdad, who was not American or British.\"They want to get rid of the militia and it seems they will succeed in getting one.\"MALIKI BOLSTEREDSadr's supporters twice launched armed uprisings against the U.S. occupation in 2004 but have since formally joined the U.S.-sponsored political process.A handful of Sadr's ministers suspended their participation in Maliki's government and his 30 members of parliament have also been staying away since Maliki approved a renewal of the U.S. forces' U.N. mandate a month ago.But Maliki's fragile authority among his fellow Shi'ite's has been bolstered by Saturday's hanging of Saddam Hussein, whose Sunni-led administration oppressed the Shi'ite majority.While he negotiates to end a boycott of the cabinet by moderates in Sadr's movement, other Shi'ite leaders are pushing for a crackdown on Sadr militants.\"They are jeopardizing all our efforts and achievements,\" said a senior official from another group in the main United Alliance bloc of which Sadr's group is a key part.Hundreds of Iraqis are being killed every week and hundreds of thousands have fled. Many Sunnis accuse Sadr's movement of being behind many death squad killings, a charge Sadr himself denies. They also accuse them of being controlled by Washington's enemies in neighboring, Shi'ite Islamist Iran.Impressions among Sunnis of being victims of triumphal Shi'ite militias have been reinforced by video of Saddam's hanging, in which official observers chanted \"Moqtada, Moqtada, Moqtada!\" and taunted the former leader on the gallows.Maliki has repeatedly said since taking office eight months ago that he will disband all militias but has asked for patience and insists the main threat is from Sunni insurgents.Several political sources said Maliki, from the Dawa party and a compromise choice as premier who owed his appointment to support from the populist Sadr, was trying to give political negotiations with Sadr a last chance before any crackdown.Last month, a government delegation to Najaf failed to persuade the cleric to end his boycott, however, and Maliki has said he still plans a cabinet reshuffle that government officials say could involve removing some Sadrist ministers.The head of the Sadrists bloc in the parliament said the group was working with members in the Alliance on a proposal to reschedule the timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops which then will end their boycott of the parliament.\"In response to our demands we are working with others in the Alliance on a proposal for the timetable of withdrawal. This will help ending the boycott,\" Nassar al Rubaie told Reuters.Rubaie accused U.S. commanders of trying to lure Sadr into a direct confrontation but said that he would not be provoked.But other members of the Alliance said Sadr had no choice but more clearly to disown militant Mehdi Army commanders. He has done so more than once, and even arrested some, but critics remain unconvinced that Sadr is genuine in those efforts:\"These people will only respond to force and this is what they will get,\" the senior Alliance official said. \"A decisive battle is not agreed yet but limited operations just began.\"(Additional reporting by Alastair Macdonald)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-iraq-sadr-idUSL0289137320070102", "sectors": [], "title": "iraqis see u . s . push against sadr ' s mehdi army"},

Tight monetary and fiscal policies sent financial markets soaring during Lula's first-term but helped brake growth.Lula said in his congressional address that he would cut red tape, provide tax incentives for private investment and boost public investment.Lula said an economic stimulus package later this month would be followed by measures to expand infrastructure projects and improve regulatory frameworks.Investors often complain about red tape, legal uncertainty and government intervention in industry regulators.Critics say Lula has not agreed to slash large government expenditures, which economists say are the principal obstacle to lower stifling taxes and interest rates.The charismatic former factory worker is still hugely popular among Brazil's 185 million people. An opinion poll in December showed they consider him the country's best president ever.\"He made mistakes but I support him because he's done more for the common people than any other president,\" said Antonio da Silva Lima, a 30-year-old gardener, who earns in a month what his employer earns as judge in a day.Monday's festivities lacked the excitement that marked the inauguration of Brazil's first working-class president four years ago, as supporters remembered numerous high-profile scandals. These included alleged pay-offs of congressmen and led numerous Lula aides to resign.\"He needs to keep a closer eye on some of his advisors and not delegate key political negotiations,\" said Percivaldo Junior, a 47-year-old health worker waiting outside Congress.The low-key celebration, which took place during a steady rain, drew an estimated 10,000 spectators -- a fraction of the huge crowds in 2003.A divisive election campaign had pitted Lula's mostly poor supporters against his conservative rival's wealthier voters.Lula on Monday said his efforts to redouble economic growth would neither exclude strict fiscal discipline nor slow the expansion of social welfare programs.\"I will continue doing what any mother would -- take care first of the most needy,\" he said.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-brazil-lula-idUSN2838881720070102", "sectors": [["World"]], "title": "brazil ' s lula pledges economic growth in 2nd term"},

{"date": "01:49 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "BEIJING Two surveys released this week show \nthat China's manufacturing sector posted modestly slower growth \nin December, although the key sector of the world's \nfourth-biggest economy was still expanding. Brokerage house CLSA's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) \nfell to 52.4 in December from 53.0 in November, while an index \nbased on an official survey slipped to 54.8 from 55.3. The indexes are designed to give a timely snapshot of \nbusiness conditions in the manufacturing sector. A reading \nabove 50 indicates expansion, while one below 50 shows \ncontraction. The official survey has been in positive territory above 50 \nfor two years running; CLSA's index remained above the \nboom-bust line of 50 for the 13th straight month. \"Overall, the two separate PMI series seem to suggest that \nthe near-term momentum in China's industrial activities would \nlikely hold steady, but not necessarily decelerate further,\" \nQian Wang, an economist with JPMorgan in Hong Kong, said in a \nnote to clients. A slight slowdown in the output and new orders components \nof both indexes in December suggested that a recent moderation \nin investment demand would weigh on manufacturing going \nforward, she said. New export orders fell to 55 from 57.1 in the official \nsurvey, while they rose back above the 50 mark following a \ncontraction in November, according to CLSA's reading. Jim Walker, chief economist at CLSA, said that although new \nexport orders had rebounded in December, they were likely to \nfall as the U.S. economy suffered a sharp slowdown and act as a \ndrag on overall orders growth. Although the easing in the CLSA index should help lower \nconcerns about a re-acceleration in the economy, Beijing was \nleaning toward taking further tightening steps in 2007, Walker \nsaid. Last year, China twice hoisted interest rates and raised \nthe amount of funds which lenders must hold in reserve three \ntimes as part of a long-running campaign to curb an \ninvestment-fuelled liquidity boom. A recent moderation in investment growth has offered some \nevidence that such measures have had some success, but many \neconomists expect the government to raise interest rates \nfurther and to take other tightening measures this year. Walker said Beijing would also keep close tabs on inflation \npressures after CLSA's sub-index on input prices hit 60.3 and \nthe output price index climbed to 54.9, its highest reading \nsince July. \"Chinese inflation pressures are bubbling just below the \nsurface. Difficult policy choices lie ahead for Beijing in the \nnew year,\" he said. Annual consumer price inflation remained under two percent \nin 2006, but rose to 1.9 percent in November from 1.4 percent \nin October in part due to quickly rising grain prices.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/businesspro-china-economy-clsa-dc-idUSPEK13488120070102", "sectors": [], "title": "chinese manufacturing growth slows in dec : surveys"},

Diplomats say such a mission may now be the only way Ethiopian can extricate its military from Somalia without leaving the government enfeebled.\"It is up to the international community to deploy a peacekeeping force in Somalia without delay to avoid a vacuum and the resurgence of extremists and terrorists,\" Meles said.He added that Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni would be visiting him in days to discuss Kampala's offer to provide the vanguard of troops for an African peacekeeping mission.Uganda's State Minister for Foreign Affairs Oryem Okello told Reuters on Tuesday Kampala was unwilling to contribute to a peacekeeping mission for Somalia unless its mission and an exit strategy were clearly defined.Ethiopia's military, one of the strongest in Africa, beat the Islamists surprisingly quickly, first pushing them back from Baidoa, then ousting them from their base in Mogadishu and their last bastion in Kismayu port.Without Ethiopia's military, the government would have been relatively defenseless against the Islamists, who had shown military prowess to defeat Mogadishu warlords in June.The Somali government, led by President Abdullahi Yusuf and Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi, has said Ethiopian troops will stay \"as long as we need them\" under a bilateral arrangement. Somali officials say that could continue weeks or months.\"GALLANT SOLDIERS\"Meles triumphantly lauded his troops for routing a movement whose aim, he said, was to destabilize the entire Horn of Africa region on the pretext of waging a religious war.\"The myth of the extremists -- that they would wage a Christian-Muslim war in the Horn of Africa -- has been shattered by the gallant Ethiopian forces,\" Meles said.He said fighters from the Ethiopian rebel group, the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), who had massed inside the Somali border in preparation for an attack, had been crushed. \"They have been dealt with so that they will never return again,\" he said.Another Ethiopian rebel group which had allied with the Islamists, the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF), had also been defeated at Dinsoor inside Somalia, Meles said.\"I have information that the majority of ONLF members have also been smashed,\" he said.The Ethiopian leader, who went to war with Eritrea in 1998-2000 over their border, scoffed at predictions by some analysts that Asmara would take advantage of the Somali war to try and re-take some disputed territory.\"Eritrea has now power and preparedness to wage a direct war against Ethiopia. It is so weak that it cannot venture to take such a risk,\" Meles said. \"But there is always a possibility of miscalculation on the Eritrean side, and if that happens we are prepared to rebut the attack.\"", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-somalia-conflict-meles-idUSL026596120070102", "sectors": [["World"]], "title": "ethiopia says will stay in somalia for few weeks"},

Security Council.But on Tuesday, State Minister for Foreign Affairs Oryem Okello told Reuters Uganda wanted to consult regional heads of state, especially Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, on the mission's purpose and exit strategy, before going in.\"We want to know: what is our objective? How long are we going to stay? And how will we be able to pull out? All these have to be answered before we consider going in,\" Okello said.In just two weeks, Ethiopian troops, tanks and fighter jets have allowed the interim government to break out of its provincial enclave, drive the Somalia Islamic Courts Council (SICC) from Mogadishu and end six months of Islamist rule across much of the south.Despite the Islamists' surprisingly quick flight, analysts and diplomats fear they may still pose a security threat by resorting to guerrilla tactics.The United States, which is widely thought to have given tacit approval to Ethiopia's intervention, has said it would support efforts to deploy African peacekeepers.IGAD had agreed Somalia's immediate neighbors should not be part of a peacekeeping force, adding to pressure on Uganda to take on the role. Diplomats say Washington is particularly keen to have a regional ally involved.But Kampala fears getting sucked into a wider regional conflict in the volatile Horn of Africa nation.

By contrast, the next move on U.S. interest rates is likely to be a cut from 5.25 percent after a steady policy in recent months.Japanese rates are seen rising at a very gradual pace from 0.25 percent -- maintaining the euro's yield advantage.HUNT FOR YIELDThe Yomiuri newspaper reported the Bank of Japan would consider raising rates at its January 17-18 policy meeting, but added a hike might be delayed depending on \"adjustments\" between the BOJ and the government and ruling parties.The Australian dollar hit nine-year highs above 94.50 yen AUDJPY=R as the market priced in more risk of a further increase in Australian interest rates.The dollar maintained an overall weaker bias, down 0.17 percent at 118.86 yen JPY=.Financial markets are still pricing in at least one rate cut for the United States in 2007, although surprising strength in some recent data has pushed out the timing of any move.The minutes of the Federal Reserve's December policy meeting may help refine the outlook for rates. The minutes were due to be released on Tuesday but have been put back to Wednesday due to the national holiday.The ISM reading on manufacturing is also due on Wednesday along with vehicle sales, while Friday has the December payrolls report.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-markets-forex-idUSN2941694320070102", "sectors": [["Asian Markets"]], "title": "forex - euro hits record peak vs yen as yields in focus"},

Security council in October. He has visited headquarters surrounded by dozens of his Korean colleagues.But Ban, 62, a former foreign minister whose English is relatively fluent and his French halting, says he will arrive at work early on Tuesday for a speech to U.N. staff that will be broadcast by video to its offices abroad.Over the weekend his office announced two appointments. Indian Vijay Nambiar, a former adviser to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, was named as his chief of staff and Michele Montas, an award-winning Haitian journalist as his chief spokeswoman.But other top posts may not be filled for some time, except for administration and management, which U.N. sources say will go to Alicia Barcena, Annan's former chief of staff, to replace American Christopher Burnham. Ban also has not yet named a deputy secretary-general, expected to be a woman, or filled the key posts of peacekeeping and political affairs, which France, the United States and Britain want.Ban, who officially became secretary-general on New Year's Day, faces the same global issues Annan did -- the carnage in Sudan's Darfur, peacekeepers in 18 countries, tensions in the Middle East and combating poverty.He said he hoped to be known \"as a secretary-general who is accessible, hard-working, and prepared to listen attentively.\"Annan, a 68-year old Ghanaian, who was secretary-general for 10 years, and his elegant wife Swedish wife Nane, the lawyer-artist niece of Holocaust hero Raoul Wallenberg, left New York for Europe on Monday after spending New Year's Eve with close friends at a Cajun jazz club. They intend to take weeks of rest at an undisclosed location.U.N. REFORMSMany of Ban's public comments have dealt with U.N. management issues. He has pledged generally to press ahead with efforts to reform the bureaucracy to make it more effective and responsive to the 192 U.N. member nations.But developing nations are expected to stymie him as they did Annan since the General Assembly controls the budget and many management posts, seeing the reforms as a Western plot to deprive them of jobs.After taking the oath of office on December 14, Ban, 62, said he would try to \"act as a harmonizer and bridge-builder\" and then joked with reporters that he was nicknamed \"a slippery eel\" but insisted he was a \"media friendly person.\"At his inauguration, he also put vowed to restore trust in the U.N. secretariat and set \"the highest ethical standard.\"The words were widely seen by diplomats as a slap at Annan, whose tenure was stained by findings of corruption and mismanagement in the $64 billion oil-for-food program for Iraq and in U.N. procurement.Compared to the idealistic Annan, Ban may say less and lead a United Nations more aware of its limitations and the small space any secretary-general has to maneuver.But Ban may be less adept at advancing the outspoken Annan's effort to give the institution a human face and a strong belief that a government's duty was to protect the rights of individuals.Still Ban told a December dinner of U.N. correspondents: \"Rest assured that my actions will be anything but slippery: I am a man of action.\"Ban is living at a hotel for months, while the elegant town house overlooking Manhattan's East River undergoes extensive structural renovations, the first since 1950.((Editing by Cynthia Osterman; Reuters messaging: Evelyn.Leopold.reuters.com@reuters.net; 1-212-355-7424)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-un-ban-idUSN0128423220070102", "sectors": [["World"]], "title": "taking office at u . n ., ban faces key decisions"},

French press reports\nhave said that Pinault would sell Suez's environmental business\nto Veolia. In the steel sector, Anglo-Dutch steel group Corus CS.L\nadded 1 percent after Indian newspapers reported Tata Steel\n(TISC.BO) would raise its bid for the company.

Many trading desks were thinly staffed as financial markets\nwere either closed or open only for a half-session on Tuesday,\nwhen the United States holds a national funeral service for the\nformer president. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association\nhas recommended an early bond market close at 2 p.m. (1900 GMT)\nand the key manufacturing report of the week, the Institute for\nSupply Management (ISM)'s index was rescheduled for Wednesday. That leaves Tuesday virtually devoid of economic data for\nbond investors. The manufacturing report on Wednesday and the\nmonthly nonfarm payrolls report, due on Friday, could be major\ncatalysts for the Treasury market. \"Given the proximity of ISM and nonfarm payrolls we deem it\nreasonable to be neutral at current levels, albeit with a bit\nof a negative bias due to the evident technical damage incurred\nlast month,\" wrote David Ader, head of government bond strategy\nwith RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut. The 10-year note's yield -- which moves inversely to its\nprice -- jumped to 4.70 percent at the end of December from\n4.46 percent at the start of last month. On Tuesday, benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR edged up\n1/32 in price for a yield of 4.70 percent, versus 4.70 percent\nlate on Friday. Markets had been closed on Monday for the New\nYear's Day public holiday. Two-year notes US2YT=RR -- which respond closely to\nexpectations for Federal Reserve interest rate moves -- inched\nup 1/32 in price to yield 4.80 percent, compared with 4.82\npercent on Friday. The Treasury market \"is opening up stronger, reversing some\nof the weakness of last week,\" wrote Andrew Brenner, head of\nglobal fixed-income at Hapoalim Securities  in New York in a\ndaily research note on Tuesday. Last week, stronger-than-expected U.S. economic reports\nweighed on bond prices as prospects of a Federal Reserve\ninterest rate cut early this year appeared to dwindle. \"The November data, at least, reinforces the idea the Fed's\non hold,\" Ader wrote. Home sales, consumer confidence and a Chicago manufacturing\nindex all exceeded market forecasts. Prospects for the Fed to lower rates by June, as shown by\nshort-term U.S. interest rate futures, had fallen to about 58\npercent late on Friday after being fully priced as recently\nas Dec. 21.

It is characterized by anxiety, reexperiences of the event and avoidance of stimuli related to the experience.Based on commonly-used measures of stress disorder symptoms used in the Harvard study, each step up in symptom severity increased the risk of a heart attack by 26 percent, the report said.\"This pattern of effects suggests that individuals with higher levels of (post-traumatic stress disorder) symptoms are not simply prone to reporting higher levels of chest pain or other physical symptoms but may well be at higher risk for developing coronary heart disease,\" wrote study author Laura Kubzansky in the Archives of General Psychiatry.An unrelated study in the same journal from the Netherlands found veterans who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder were less sensitive to pain than counterparts without the disorder.Twenty-four Dutch veterans were subjected to variable temperatures on their hands by researchers at Central Military Hospital and the Rudolph Magnus Institute of Neuroscience, Utrecht, led by Elbert Geuze. The 12 who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder rated the pain \"significantly\" less severe than those without the disorder.Images taken of the veterans' brains during the temperature experiment showed those with the disorder processed the pain differently in regions of the brain associated with mood and cognition.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-veterans-trauma-idUSN2925306820070102", "sectors": [["U.S., ", "Health"]], "title": "study links post - traumatic stress to heart disease"},
{"date": "08:23 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "MOGADISHU Perhaps the most telling sign of Somalia's remarkable power shift is the rapid return to Mogadishu's streets of the leafy twigs known as 'khat'.Traditionally chewed by most Somali men, but outlawed since June by hardline Islamists, the mild stimulant reappeared within hours of Mogadishu's recapture by government forces last week.\"I am happy that miraa (khat) is back on the street. Now we can work because it gives us some energy,\" said Abdi Awale, a Mogadishu resident. \"But my expenses will go up again.\"Normally chewed in the afternoons and evenings, the leaf releases a mild stimulant, although users later feel down. It has a central place in Somali social gatherings, and gives a livelihood to traders and importers.The Somali Islamic Courts Council (SICC) beat a hasty retreat from the capital and much of the south they had controlled for six months after a two-week war with government forces backed by Ethiopian troops.After defeating warlords from Mogadishu in June last year, the SICC had brought some semblance of order to one of the most dangerous cities in the world.This attracted support from residents who have known little but violent anarchy, bitter clan rivalry and squabbling warlords since dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted in 1991.But bent on introducing sharia, Islamic law, the Islamists angered Somalis who are traditionally moderate Muslims after they formally banned the popular khat in November.The movement also sparked protests in some towns after it introduced other hardline practices such as closing cinemas, prohibiting smoking and some music and enforcing dress codes.The Somali interim government, led by President Abdullahi Yusuf, had sharply criticised the khat ban.Trader Habibo Ali said her khat business was slowly picking up although the volume of the stimulant coming into Somalia remained low because Kenya had a direct flight ban to the Horn of Africa nation. Direct flights from Kenya to Somalia must receive special government clearance.\"I am happy that I can sell what I am used to selling for the last 25 years,\" she said.The reintroduction of khat was also good news for Kenyan peasant farmers who grow and export the crop to Mogadishu in small cargo aircraft. Khat is not widely used in Kenya.\"The business has started to pick up,\" David Kirimi, a trader at eastern Maua township told Reuters by telephone. \"The quantities that were being demanded have not recovered fully but there is some improvement.\"Hundreds of Kenyan khat growers in the eastern province of Meru, where many farmers have uprooted coffee in favor of the profitable khat, had held street protests, saying the Somali ban had denied them their livelihoods.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-somalia-conflict-khat-idUSL0291421520070102", "sectors": [["World"]], "title": "somali islamists are gone -- so ' khat ' is back !"},

{"date": "08:36 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " (Updates prices, quotes) By Lincoln FeastLONDON Jan 2 (Reuters) - Global stock markets made a\npositive start to 2007, hitting fresh record peaks on Tuesday,\nwhile the euro rose as still solid manufacturing data supported\nexpectations of more euro zone interest rate rises. On the first day of trade for the year, the MSCI All-Country\nWorld Index .MSCIWD rose 0.7 percent to a new all-time peak of\n370.4 points as markets in Hong Kong .HSI and Australia\n.AXJO hit record highs. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 Index .FTEU3 climbed 1\npercent to 1,499 points, its highest intraday level since Feb.\n2001. Volumes were light with U.S. stock markets closed to mark\nthe death of former President Gerald Ford and Tokyo markets also\nclosed. Stocks ended a strong 2006 on a high and most strategists\nsee the potential for further gains, supported by still\nreasonable valuations, earnings growth and a relatively robust\nglobal economy. \"We think European equity markets will rise again over the\ncourse of 2007. Our forecast suggests a total return of 14\npercent,\" said Ian Scott, a strategist at Lehman Brothers. \"While we foresee headwinds of declining earnings growth, we\nbelieve that favourable valuations of equities relative to other\nasset classes, and supportive fund flows, will provide scope for\nfurther outperformance.\" Others including Morgan Stanley said macro economic concerns\ncould cause some short-term jitters and recommended investors\nbuy some protection against a correction in the coming months. Early manufacturing data from the euro zone showed growth\nremained strong, but off its mid-year peak.\n The RBS/NTC Eurozone Purchasing Managers' Index slipped to a\nnine-month low of 56.5 in December but the average reading for\n2006 of 56.3 was more than five points higher than the average\n2005 reading and well above the 50 level that separates growth\nfrom contraction. Mark Miller, an economist at HBOS Treasury Services, said an\nunexpected slowdown in French manufacturing growth accounted for\nmuch of the weakness across the euro zone.  \"Encouragingly, the export component has held up even in the\nface of a U.S. slowdown,\" he said. \"There's nothing in these surveys that suggests (euro zone\ninterest) rates don't go up in the first quarter of this year,\nprobably in March.\"\n EURO STRONG Solid economic data and expectations of further interest\nrate rises from the European Central Bank underpinned a strong\n2006 for the euro which rose some 11 percent against the dollar. The euro began 2007 in a similar vein, rising against the\ndollar and hitting a record high against the yen at 157.72 yen\nEURJPY=. \"We're starting the year very much the way we left last\nyear, with a high-yield/low-yield story. You've got ECB rate\nexpectations fairly robust and question marks about what the\nFederal Reserve will do,\" Mellon Bank head of currency research\nIan Gunner said. The euro was 0.6 percent higher on the session at $1.3273,\nwhile the dollar was down 0.2 percent at 118.85 yen JPY=. Currencies such as the Australian AUD= and New Zealand\ndollar NZD= also made strong starts to 2007, benefiting from\ntheir interest rate advantages over other currencies especially\nthe yen. The Australian dollar hit nine-year highs above 94.30 yen\nAUDJPY=R as the market priced in more risk of a further\nincrease in Australian interest rates.\n BONDS REBOUND, COMMODITIES MIXED The firmer euro lent support to euro zone government bonds,\nwhich were battered in December as expectations of U.S. interest\nrate cuts early this year faded.  The March Bund future FGBLH7 was up 32 ticks at 116.35,\nextending gains after the weaker-than-forecast PMI data. U.S. ISM manufacturing data, originally due for release on\nTuesday at 1500 GMT, was delayed until Wednesday due to the day\nof mourning for President Ford, while markets were also looking\nahead to Friday's non-farm payrolls report. A robust jobs market has helped U.S. consumer spending hold\nup in the face of a housing market slump, with lower energy\nprices also lending support. Oil prices ticked higher in holiday-disrupted trade on\nTuesday, with U.S. light crude CLc1 up around 30 cents a\nbarrel to $61.35 amid forecasts of continued mild weather in the\nU.S. Northeast. Other commodities were mixed, with gold hitting a one-month\nhigh near $641 an ounce on the back of the weaker dollar, but\ncopper MCU3 fell as stocks in London Metal Exchange-registered\nwarehouses leapt to their highest since March 2004.\n\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/markets-global-idUSL0290679420070102", "sectors": [["Bonds"]], "title": "global markets - stocks start 2007 at record peaks , euro strong"},

{"date": "08:57 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "CALGARY, Alberta A chunk of ice bigger than the area of Manhattan broke from an ice shelf in Canada's far north and could wreak havoc if it starts to float westward toward oil-drilling regions and shipping lanes next summer, a researcher said on Friday.Global warming could be one cause of the break of the Ayles Ice Shelf at Ellesmere Island, which occurred in the summer of 2005 but was only detected recently by satellite photos, said Luke Copland, assistant professor at the University of Ottawa's geography department.It was the largest such break in nearly three decades, casting an ice floe with an area of 66 square km (25 square miles) adrift in the Arctic Ocean, said Copland, who specializes in the study of glaciers and ice masses. Manhattan has an area of 61 square km (24 square miles).The mass is now 50 square km (19 square miles) in size.\"The Arctic is all frozen up for the winter and it's stuck in the sea ice about 50 km (30 miles) off the coast,\" he said.\"The risk is that next summer, as that sea ice melts, this large ice island can then move itself around off the coast and one potential path for it is to make its way westward toward the Beaufort Sea, and the Beaufort Sea is where there is lots of oil and gas exploration, oil rigs and shipping.\"The break went undetected when it happened due primarily to the remoteness of the northern coast of Ellesmere island, which is only about 800 km (500 miles) from the North Pole.The speed of the crack and drift-off shocked scientists.Satellite images showed the 15-km long (9-mile long) crack, then the ice floating about 1 km (0.6 miles) from the coast within about an hour, Copland said.\"You could stand at one edge and not see the other side, and for something that large to move that quickly is quite amazing,\" he said.Copland said the break was likely due to a combination of low accumulations of sea ice around the mass's edges as high winds blew it away, as well as one of the Arctic's warmest temperatures on record. The region was 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees F) above average in the summer of 2005, he said.Ice shelves in Canada's far north have decreased in size by as much as 90 percent since 1906, and global warming likely played a role in the Ayles break, Copland said.\"It's hard to tie one event to climate change, but when you look at the longer-term trend, the bigger picture, we've lost a lot of ice shelves on northern Ellesmere in the past century and this is that continuing,\" he said. \"And this is the biggest one in the last 25 years.\"", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-arctic-iceshelf-break-idUSN2929408220070102", "sectors": [["Science"]], "title": "huge ice shelf breaks free in canada ' s far north"},

At 9:00 a.m. (1400 GMT), the Canadian unit was at C$1.1645\nto the U.S. dollar, or 85.87 U.S. cents, up from C$1.1654 to\nthe U.S. dollar, or 85.81 U.S. cents, at Friday's close. Canadian markets were closed on Monday. The commodity-linked Canadian dollar took advantage of gold\nprices that reached their highest level in nearly one month as\nthe weaker U.S. dollar boosted demand for the metal. But the gains were limited as oil prices hovered just above\n$61 a barrel as mild weather in the United States capped demand\nfor fuel and weighed on prices. The commodity-linked Canadian dollar often shadows the\nmoves in oil and gold prices since Canada is a producer and net\nexporter of oil and many base metals. But many expect the Bank of Canada's Monetary Policy Report\nin mid-January to reflect the recent wave of weaker economic\ndata, and dealers said that is keeping the Canadian dollar in\ncheck. Concerns about a weaker North American economy and the\nlikelihood of lower interest rates on both sides of the border\nhave weighed on the Canadian and U.S. dollars recently. \"We've had most of the data come out over the last couple\nof months on the soft side and I think this is definitely going\nto be reflected when we get the Monetary Policy Report from the\nBank of Canada,\" said Carolyn Kwan, markets economist at Scotia\nCapital.\" \"The fundamental story is weighing on the Canadian dollar\nfor sure and in addition we have commodity prices weakening off\nmore broadly.\" Giving the Canadian dollar a slight boost was news that\nU.S. steelmaker Nucor Corp. (NUE.N) agreed to purchase Canada's\nHarris Steel Group Inc. HSG.TO for C$1.25 billion. Foreign takeovers of Canadian companies -- and the\naccompanying purchase of Canadian dollars to finance them --\nhave been key supports for the currency. BONDS UP IN THIN TRADE Domestic bonds prices bounced back slightly after falling\nall of last week, but thin liquidity exaggerated the move. U.S. treasuries will close early for a day of mourning to\nhonor former U.S. President Gerald Ford, while Japanese markets\nwere closed for a market holiday. \"We've got generally quiet conditions all around and people\nare going to be taking today to reassess the picture and see\nhow things should be set up for the new year,\" said Kwan. The the two-year bond was up 4 Canadian cents at C$100.45\nto yield 4.003 percent, while the 10-year bond was up 26\nCanadian cents at C$99.61 to yield 4.050 percent. The yield spread between the two-year and 10-year bond\nmoved to 5.2 basis points from 6.2 at the previous close. The 30-year bond rose 53 Canadian cents to C$125.25 to\nyield 4.111 percent. In the United States, the 30-year treasury\nyielded 4.783 percent. The three-month when-issued T-bill yielded 4.16 percent, up\nfrom 4.15 percent at the previous close.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/markets-canada-dollar-bonds-idUSN0229934320070102", "sectors": [["Bonds"]], "title": "canada dollar follows gold high , bonds inch higher"},

{"date": "08:57 31 December 2006 (UTC)", "text": "LONDON Russian gas giant Gazprom's decision to \ntake a majority stake in the Royal Dutch Shell-led Sakhalin-2 \nproject may save the European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment (EBRD) from having to approve its most \ncontroversial loan application ever. Analysts and industry executives said the fact Gazprom is \ngovernment-controlled means the EBRD will likely be precluded \nby its charter from extending a loan to the project. The bank was founded to help the countries of the former \nSoviet bloc move toward market economies but the Sakhalin deal \n-- which followed months of pressure on the project partners \nfrom the Russian government -- amounts to a renationalization \nof the Sakhalin-2 oil and gas fields, analysts say. \"This new development certainly does make it more difficult \nfor the bank (to participate) and it may certainly make the \nEBRD less needed in the project,\" said Brigid Janssen, the \nEBRD's director of communications. Shortly before Gazprom, Shell and their Japanese partners \nMitsui and Mitsubishi in the $22 billion project announced the \ndeal on December 21, Mitsui and Mitsubishi told analysts that \nthe project may no longer seek financing from the EBRD and \nother western government-backed lenders. Previously, the EBRD was under pressure from its owners -- \nmainly western nations -- to approve the strategic project, \nsources inside the EBRD and industry sources said, despite \nsharp criticism from environmentalists.\n POOR RECORD The EBRD is supposed to demand strict environmental \ncompliance from its borrowers and green groups said Shell's \npoor record in managing Sakhalin-2 meant the project did not \nqualify. Janssen said the EBRD had not yet decided on whether the \nproject met its environmental criteria and had yet not decided \nwhether Gazprom's involvement precluded a loan. Sakhalin-2 is 80 percent complete and industry executives \nand analysts expect the project to be completed irrespective of \nwhether it secures a $6 billion to 7 billion finance package \nfrom the EBRD and others. Oil and gas production will occur near the feeding grounds \nof the endangered Western Gray Whale and pipelines transporting \nthe oil and gas must cross more than 1,100 rivers and water \ncourses. Shell admitted failings but said these had been rectified. EBRD insiders conceded the bank's reputation as an \nenvironmentally conscientious lender was on the line but the \nbank feels its involvement over recent years had prodded Shell \nto improve the project's record. The EBRD's strict environmental rules mean other lenders \noften base their lending decisions on whether the bank decides \na project is environmentally sound. Gazprom's involvement in the project, at what analysts saw \nas a knock-down price, is a big blow for Shell. Following the \ndeal, analysts at Citigroup cut their earnings forecasts for \nthe Anglo-Dutch oil major by 4 percent after 2009, when the \nproject comes fully onstream.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/businesspro-gazprom-shell-sakhalin-dc-idUSL3188275620070102", "sectors": [], "title": "gazprom ' s sakhalin - 2 buy may let ebrd off the hook"},

As well, fresh merger and acquisition activity, with the\nproposed C$1.25 billion purchase of Harris Steel Group Inc.HSG.TO by Nucor Corp. (NUE.N) announced before the opening\nbell, could bode well for Canadian equities. The exchange's main S&P/TSX composite index rose 14.5\npercent in 2006, in no small part thanks to a piping hot mining\nsector that helped drive the gains. \"We have seen some strength on the materials side over the\ncourse of the last week or so, and we expect to see further\nstrength really throughout the year,\" said Neil Andrew,\nassociate portfolio manager at Leeward Hedge Funds in Toronto. The resources-heavy materials group of the composite\nreturned 38 percent in 2006. The day's session could also see gold miners' gains\nextended, as the price of their product rose to its highest in\nnearly a month while the euro rose against the U.S. dollar. \"The U.S. dollar was overdue for a bounce,\" Andrew said.\n\"Now that seems to be likely to unwind, naturally supportive to\ngold prices.\" A weaker dollar can spur demand for gold, which in turn\ncould bode well for the share prices of Canadian gold miners,\nwhich include companies such as Barrick Gold Corp.

{"date": "18:05 31 December 2006 (UTC)", "text": "MOSCOW Russia and Belarus announced a \nlast-minute deal on gas prices on Monday, moments before Moscow \nwas to start cutting off supplies with potential disruption for \ncustomers in Europe. Belarus Prime Minister Sergei Sidorsky arrived at Russian \ngas monopoly Gazprom's Moscow headquarters barely 30 minutes \nbefore Sunday's midnight deadline to sign the deal. Gazprom (GAZP.MM) had threatened to cut supplies to Belarus \nfrom January 1 if a deal on new gas prices to its neighbor was \nnot reached by midnight. Minsk said it would retaliate by \nhalting Russian gas crossing the country on its way to Western \nEurope. \"A mid-term agreement was reached on gas prices to Belarus \nand on transit shipments to Europe,\" Gazprom boss Alexei Miller \ntold a news briefing early on Monday. Russia supplies around a quarter of Europe's gas demands \nand pumps 20 percent of this amount through Belarus. The gas row revived memories of a similar dispute with \nex-Soviet Ukraine exactly one year ago which briefly disrupted \nRussian deliveries to Europe and shook confidence in Russia's \nreliability as an energy supplier. Under the accord, Belarus agreed to pay Gazprom $100 per \n1,000 cubic meters of natural gas, up from the $46 ex-Soviet \nBelarus has been paying until now.\n VISIBLY DISPLEASED By comparison, Gazprom charges European customers over \n$250. In the past 12 months, Russia has agreed hefty price rises \nwith ex-Soviet Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia and Moldova. \"The terms which have been fixed in this current agreement \nare the best which exist on the territory of the Former Soviet \nUnion,\" Miller said. Around 10 million people live in Belarus. Its economy is \nstill largely run on a Soviet-style command system and its \nindustry relies heavily on cheap energy imports to remain \nprofitable. Western critics have accused the Kremlin of using the gas \nprice increases as a political weapon to punish some of its \nneighbors for moving closer to the West. Belarus though does not fit into that category. Its \nPresident Alexander Lukashenko has quarreled with the West and \nwants closer ties with Moscow. At the joint press conference Belarus Prime Minister \nSidorsky looked visibly displeased by the price rises. \"We don't have much natural resources. You (Russia) have \nput us in a difficult situation, but we will stay strong,\" he \nsaid. In the deal Gazprom will also pay $2.5 billion to control \nhalf of Belarus's pipelines for four years and agreed to pay \ndouble to transit gas through Belarus to Europe.

{"date": "09:38 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "NEW YORK Jan 2 U.S. government bond prices rose\non Tuesday in a modest recovery from last week's sell-off on\nstronger than expected economic reports, traders said. Volume was light during a session shortened for a day of\nmourning to honor former U.S. President Gerald Ford. Many trading\ndesks were thinly staffed as financial markets were either closed\nor open only for a half-session on Tuesday, when the United States\nholds a national funeral service for the former president. \"This is that sort of bounce that you get after the pounding\nthe bond market took last week,\" said Kevin Flanagan, fixed income\nstrategist for global wealth management with Morgan Stanley in\nPurchase, New York. \"I wouldn't read too much into it and we are still at a kind\nof half staffed situation,\" Flanagan said. The key question once the market reacts to the manufacturing\nand jobs reports later this week is how U.S. government debt\ninvestors view the 10-year note's 4.70 percent yield level after\nlast month's sell-off, Flanagan added. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR were up 1/32 in price for\na yield of 4.70 percent, versus 4.70 percent late on Friday.\nMarkets had been closed on Monday for the New Year's Day public\nholiday. Two-year notes US2YT=RR, which respond closely to\nexpectations for Federal Reserve interest rate moves, rose 1/32 in\nprice to yield 4.80 percent, compared with 4.82 percent on\nFriday. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association has\nrecommended an early bond market close at 2 p.m. (1900 GMT) and\nthe key manufacturing report of the week, the Institute for Supply\nManagement (ISM)'s index has been rescheduled for Wednesday. That leaves Tuesday virtually devoid of economic data for bond\ninvestors. The manufacturing report on Wednesday and the monthly\nnonfarm payrolls report, due on Friday, could be major catalysts\nfor the Treasury market. \"Given the proximity of ISM and nonfarm payrolls we deem it\nreasonable to be neutral at current levels, albeit with a bit of a\nnegative bias due to the evident technical damage incurred last\nmonth,\" wrote David Ader, head of government bond strategy with\nRBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut in a daily\nresearch note. The 10-year note's yield, which moves inversely to its price,\njumped to 4.70 percent at the end of December from 4.46 percent at\nthe start of last month. Last week, stronger-than-expected U.S. economic reports on\nhome sales, consumer confidence and a Chicago manufacturing index\nweighed on bond prices as prospects of a Federal Reserve interest\nrate cut early this year appeared to dwindle. \"The November data, at least, reinforces the idea the Fed's on\nhold,\" Ader wrote. Prospects for the Fed to lower rates by June, as shown by\nshort-term U.S. interest rate futures, had fallen to about 58\npercent late on Friday after being fully priced as recently\nas Dec. 21. Further insight into the Federal Reserve's thinking may come\nfrom the release on Wednesday of the minutes from its\nlast monetary policy meeting on Dec 12.

{"date": "09:48 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "LOS ANGELES Adam Scott or Trevor Immelman? Padraig Harrington or Chris DiMarco? Henrik Stenson or Justin Rose?A perennial pastime for golf fans before the start of a new season is speculating which players will break through at the highest level over the coming months.While the dominance of world number one Tiger Woods is all-but guaranteed for 2007, the on-going search for his heir apparent has so far been fruitless.Masters champion Phil Mickelson and three-times major winners Vijay Singh and Ernie Els have enjoyed spells close to, or briefly at, the game's summit but none have maintained the consistency to usurp Tiger's hold in the tournaments that matter the most.Driven by his desire to be the best player in history, Woods has painstakingly won 12 major titles, three more than the combined totals achieved by Mickelson and co.Peerless in the way he prepares for the majors and meticulously works out his tournament schedule for each year, Woods has distanced himself from his closest challengers.Although fellow American Mickelson, Fijian Singh and South African Els have the ability to make a significant impact at this year's majors, none of them are in the flush of golfing youth.Left-hander Mickelson is 36, Singh 43 and Els, below his best last year while recovering from knee surgery, 37.Of the three, Mickelson has the strongest claim to Woods's crown based on form over the last 12 months.BOUNCE BACKHowever, the entire golfing world will watch with interest to see if the gifted Californian can bounce back from his U.S. Open meltdown at Winged Foot last June.Mickelson, who had won the previous two majors, blew a golden opportunity for victory with a wild drive and a double-bogey six at the final hole.Shell-shocked after folding with the title within his grasp, he told reporters: \"I just can't believe I did that. I am such an idiot.\"Had he triumphed, he would have been widely recognized as the game's leading player after Woods missed the cut that week for the first time in a major as a professional.But the wounded Mickelson barely registered on the golfing barometer for the rest of the year as Woods took over, edging closer to his career target of overhauling the 18 career majors posted by his idol Jack Nicklaus.Former world number one Nick Faldo, who like Woods completely overhauled his swing in pursuit of golfing excellence, believes the title-hungry American will achieve his long-term goal.\"He's phenomenal, he's quite amazing,\" six-times major champion Faldo told Reuters in an interview late last year.\"The way he swings, the way he plays, nobody else could do that. He does it through sheer physical strength: his arms, his rotator cuffs, his whole body.NEW LEVEL\"We all say we want to train specifically for golf, but like everything else he does, he has taken that to a new level.\"What he does out of the rough is amazing. He hits 50 percent of the fairways but he's like number one or number two in greens just about every week coming from the rough.\"He's got the desire, he's got the determination. He's going to be around until he has beaten Jack's record and decides how many more majors he wants to add after that.\"If Faldo is correct in his assessment, it is probably wise to confine the search for Woods's likeliest challenger to the younger brigade, players who have no mental scar tissue because of missed opportunities at the majors.In this group, Australians Geoff Ogilvy and Scott, South African Immelman, Swede Stenson and Britain's Luke Donald and Justin Rose come to mind.Ogilvy, winner of last year's U.S. Open after benefiting from collapses by Mickelson and Colin Montgomerie at the 72nd hole, has already made his mark at the highest level.The 29-year-old, a keen student of the game, has long been regarded as a class act by his peers and is almost certain to be a factor at this year's majors.Scott, 26, Immelman, 27, Donald, 29, and Stenson, 30, cemented places in the world's top 15 with polished performances and victories in big events last year. All four are extremely talented golfers known for mental strength and a hunger to reach the very top.Englishman Rose, 26, ended a four-year title drought on the European Tour by winning the Australian Masters in November and appears ready to fulfil the rich potential he showed as an amateur.His golf has taken a significant leap forward since he ended a long association with top swing coach David Leadbetter midway through last year and the majors could be the making of him in 2007.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-golf-column-idUSSP15109720070102", "sectors": [["Sports"]], "title": "search still wide open for heir apparent to woods"},

{"date": "09:13 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " (Recasts, adds quotes background) By Alister Doyle, Environment CorrespondentOSLO Jan 2 (Reuters) - Norway plans to join Britain in\noffsetting greenhouse gases caused by bureaucrats jetting around\nthe world, announcing it will buy emissions quotas to combat\nglobal warming. Emissions from jet fuel burnt on international flights are\namong the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gases with\ncheaper flights but are exempted under the U.N.'s Kyoto Protocol\nfor fighting climate change until 2012. \"The government has decided that when state employees travel\nby plane abroad, we will buy quotas for the emissions caused by\nthe trip,\" Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said in a\nNew Year speech. He did not say how much it would cost. Britain has been capturing emissions by government and\nministerial air travel since April 2006. The government said\nlast week it was spending up to 3 million pounds ($5.92 million)\nto buy 255,000 tonnes of carbon credits for 2007-09. \"These two governments are the only ones I know of with\nthese projects,\" said Sue Welland, founder of the British-based\nCarbonNeutral Company which promotes investments in solar power,\nwindmills or forests to counter emissions from fossil fuels.\n COMPANIES LEAD \"A lot of companies are doing this already -- in that\nrespect governments are behind the private sector,\" Welland\nsaid. She said corporate tenders rose tenfold in late 2006 over\na year earlier and individuals were getting far more involved. Companies including car rental group Avis Europe AVE.L or\nNorwegian oil group Statoil (STL.OL) are among those offsetting\nemissions from employees' flights. Some airlines offer the\noption of paying extra to offset emissions. A 2002 U.N. Earth Summit in Johannesburg was the first major\ngovernmental meeting to try to be \"carbon neutral\", funding\nrenewable energy projects to soak up emissions from delegates'\nuse of fossil fuels in everything from transport to electricity. But only a handful of nations among 200 signed up and the\nproject fell far short of a $5 million target. \"I think this is a very good idea when international\naviation is not a part of the Kyoto Protocol,\" Lars Haltbrekken,\nchairman of Friends of the Earth Norway, said of the government\noffsets. Still, it might smack of tokenism. Norway is the world's number three oil producer and\ngreenhouse gas emissions were 10.3 percent above 1990 levels in\n2004. Britain's emissions were 14.3 percent below 1990 after a\nsharp decline in use of polluting coal. Kyoto obliges 35 rich nations to cut emissions to 5 percent\nbelow 1990 levels by 2008-12 as a first step to prevent a\nwarming that most scientists say will cause floods, heatwaves,\nextinctions and raise global sea levels.\n\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/norway-greenhouse-idUSL0285713920070102", "sectors": [], "title": "update 1 - norway , uk try to tackle planes ' greenhouse gases"},
{"date": "09:56 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "BEIRUT Assassinated leaders are very much alive in Lebanese politics.The commemoration of leaders blown up or shot dead is a tradition in a country plagued for decades by political killings and civil violence.Anti-Syrian politicians and journalists killed in the past two years in the latest wave of political violence remain symbols of the cause for which they stood.Their names and faces have been deployed in a media campaign to rally support for the government, controlled by anti-Syrian politicians, as it tries to repel a political challenge from the Damascus-backed opposition.\"It's a war of symbols -- a war of pictures,\" said Oussama Safa of the Lebanese Center for Policy Studies.Justice for the victims such as former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri is vital to the politicians who have worked to curb Syrian influence in Lebanon.The establishment of an international tribunal to try suspects is one issue at the heart of the current political split -- Lebanon's most serious since its 1975-1990 civil war.\"We won't forget,\" declare posters around Beirut. They form part of a media campaign recalling the attacks, the first of which was the huge bomb blast that killed Hariri in 2005.Billboards remind passers-by of how the victims were killed or wounded. They show the aftermath -- the remains of blown-up vehicles or bullet holes in a car window -- alongside pictures of those targeted.GLORIFICATION OF DEATHThe campaign is part of a tradition of remembering the dead.\"From the civil war onwards, death is ingrained in the political culture,\" said Amal Saad Ghorayeb, a visiting fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"This is an inherent part of Arab political culture.\"In the civil war, posters of assassinated leaders were used to define which militia controlled which area and to entrench sectarian animosity.\"It's very much a glorification of death, not only among Islamists but Christians as well,\" said Ghorayeb, an expert on the Shi'ite Islamist group Hezbollah, which celebrates its guerrillas who have died fighting Israel.Lebanon's opposition, led by Hezbollah, declared as a martyr a Shi'ite Muslim activist shot dead while returning from an anti-government protest in December.His portrait was put up at the site of the round-the-clock protest being staged by the opposition in central Beirut to demand the resignation of the anti-Damascus government.The paraphernalia deployed by the anti-Syrian coalition, known as the March 14 Movement, is far more extensive.Its leaders often wear badges depicting the dead, whose pictures appear daily in newspapers and on television. Hariri's portrait is displayed at official meetings on a chair next to his son and political heir, Saad.\"I would use the word iconography,\" anthropologist Samer el-Karanshawy said, describing the use of pictures. \"It is making these people into icons -- sacred.\"Pierre Gemayel was the last anti-Syrian politician to be assassinated. He was shot dead in November.TEMPORARY BOOSTGemayel's allies turned his funeral into a mass protest against Damascus, giving their cause a temporary boost.\"Who said that the martyrs die?\" said Gemayel's father, former president Amin Gemayel in a speech in December.\"Pierre is alive in the consciousness of his colleagues in the March 14 Movement, in the battle for national change and complete liberation,\" he said in the address to the Kataeb Party, which is dominated by the Gemayel family.Setting up an international court to try suspects in the attacks is a priority for the anti-Syrian coalition, which blames Damascus for the killings. Syria denies involvement.The opposition says it supports the idea of the tribunal but wants to discuss the details, while anti-Syrian leaders say the opposition wants to bring down the cabinet primarily to thwart the establishment of the court to shield Damascus.The bereaved hope the tribunal will be the means for them to avenge their dead, Karanshawy said.Many of the March 14 leaders were driven into politics by the assassination of a father, a husband or a son during the civil war. Some blame the killings on Syria.Keeping alive the memory of the dead \"reinforces the legitimacy of their political quest and reinforces a sense of vendetta\", Karanshawy said.\"For these people, the international tribunal is a means of protection and getting back at the killers.\"", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-lebanon-dead-idUSL2215259520070102", "sectors": [], "title": "dead leaders drive lebanese political life"},

{"date": "10:04 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "BAGHDAD The execution of Saddam Hussein and footage showing Shi'ite officials taunting him on the gallows is a blow to Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's calls for national reconciliation, a top Sunni lawmaker said on Tuesday.Saleem al-Jibouri, from the Iraqi Accordance Front, the largest Sunni Arab parliamentary bloc, said the government's decision to rush through the execution and the degrading hanging video have hardened perceptions among Sunni Arabs that the Shi'ite majority is running the state under a sectarian banner.\"The timing of the execution and the footage shown hurt the feelings of those who have the desire to join the political process,\" Jibouri, who is a leading moderate voice speaking for the Accordance bloc, told Reuters in an interview.\"The big question now is how serious is the government in calling for national reconciliation. It now has to prove it.\"Maliki, a member of the Shi'ite community oppressed under Saddam but now in the ascendancy, called on Saddam's supporters to make peace and join the political process in a statement issued shortly after Saddam was hanged in Baghdad on Saturday.There had been hopes that Maliki would host \"national reconciliation\" talks this month as a follow-up to a unity conference held in Baghdad last month that brought together Shi'ites, Sunni Arabs, ethnic Kurds and former Baathists.But the hanging video, apparently filmed on a mobile phone and showing people chanting the name of Shi'ite cleric and militia leader Moqtada al-Sadr, has inflamed sectarian passions in a country already on the brink of civil war.Hundreds of people marched through the northern city of Mosul on Tuesday carrying portraits of Saddam and banners proclaiming him a martyr and a hero. Similar demonstrations have taken place in Sunni Baghdad neighborhoods and other towns.RAPID EXECUTIONIn hanging Saddam four days after the failure of an appeal despite U.S. concerns over a rapid execution, Maliki has boosted his authority among his fractious Shi'ite allies but infuriated Sunnis already fearful of victorious Shi'ites.Jibouri said Maliki must confront hard-line elements of his Shi'ite coalition who oppose any rapprochement with ex Baathists and take steps to prove his commitment to reconciliation.\"We were expecting that the execution of Saddam will coincide with other practical steps in which the government shows Iraqis its good intentions in calling for reconciliation.\"Jibouri said freeing Sunni Arabs from prisons for alleged ties to the insurgency, many of them held without charges, would be a way of addressing complaints of victimization of Sunnis.Senior Iraqi officials have told Reuters U.S.-led forces are likely to launch a limited New Year offensive against Sadr's Mehdi militia, a move which would be warmly welcomed by Sunnis who accuse Sadr's militias of targeting their community.Jibouri said the government's image in the Muslim world had been battered by executing Saddam on the first day of the Eid al-Adha holiday. While some Shi'ites saw the hanging as an Eid gift from God, some Sunnis saw the timing as offensive.That view was echoed by a Shi'ite man whose uncle was executed by Saddam's intelligence services in 1984 on suspicion of belonging to Maliki's then-underground Dawa party.\"The government has turned a criminal into a martyr,\" the 42-year-old engineer said, though he was too afraid to give his name. \"When I heard them insulting Saddam, I realized it was not an execution. It was an act of revenge.\"", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-iraq-saddam-reconciliation-idUSIBO24507220070102", "sectors": [], "title": "saddam hanging hurts reconciliation : sunni lawmaker"},

Spokesmen for DaimlerChrysler and U.S. insurer ACE (ACE.N),\nwhich led a consortium of insurers, said that an agreement had\nbeen reached, but declined to give details. The head of ACE's German operations, Lothar Riedle, told\nReuters he hoped the settlement would spark a discussion in\nGermany about whether Director's & Officer's liability insurance\ncoverage was too broad. The Financial Times Deutschland reported on Tuesday that a\ngroup of insurance companies led by ACE had agreed shortly\nbefore the end of the year to pay DaimlerChrysler 168 million\neuros ($221.5 million) to settle the dispute. The paper did not cite sources for the story. DaimlerChrysler agreed in August 2003 to pay some U.S.\nshareholders around 275 million euros to settle allegations that\nthe 1998 deal to form the world's fifth-biggest carmaker was a\ntakeover of Chrysler by Daimler-Benz, not a merger of equals as\nthe company had said. At the time, DaimlerChrysler said insurance would cover up\nto 200 million euros of the cost. The Financial Times Deutschland said the group of insurers\nled by ACE in the talks included France's AXA (AXAF.PA),\nGermany's Gerling and HDI, Chubb (CB.N), XL Capital (XL.N),\nZurich Financial (ZURN.VX) and Basler (BALN.VX). Axa and Zurich Financial confirmed that they were part of\nthe insurance consortium deal but declined further comment,\nGerling and HDI declined comment, while Basler, Chubb, and XL\nwere not immediately available for comment. The paper said that insurer AIG (AIG.N) had already agreed\nto pay 25 million euros to Daimler and that the late December\nagreement with ACE meant that Daimler had recovered most of the\nmoney it had sought.

{"date": "10:31 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "  (Adds details, changes dateline, previous NEW YORK)CHICAGO Jan 2 (Reuters) - The Chicago Board of Trade  said\non Tuesday it logged a fifth straight year of record volume in\n2006, capped off by continued strong turnover in December. In what might have been the venerable exchange's final year\nas an independent entity, average daily volume rose by 40\npercent in December to 2.767 million contracts, pushing total\nvolume for the month up 33 percent from a year before to 55.3\nmillion contracts. There was one more trading day in December\n2005. December's average daily volume gains at the No. 2 U.S.\nfutures exchange accelerated slightly from the 38 percent\nyear-on-year increase seen in November. For all of 2006, total CBOT volume reached almost 805.9\nmillion contracts for a daily average of 3.2 million, up 20\npercent from the previous year. Total fourth-quarter volume was\nup 36 percent from a year earlier. CBOT's rate per contract for the three months through\nNovember was 64.5 cents per contract, up from 63.8 cents for\nthe three months through October and 61.8 cents in the third\nquarter. The rate per contract, a key measure of margins, is\nreported on a one-month lag. December's volume rose strongly across CBOT's four product\nsegments. Financial futures and options turnover rose 40 percent from\nDecember 2006 to account for almost 78 percent of exchange\nvolume, similar to a year before. The biggest growth was at the\nshort end of the yield curve, especially in two-year Treasury\nnotes. Average daily volume in agricultural contracts rose by 36\npercent in December and by almost 85 percent in the fourth\nquarter. Turnover has been boosted by the move to side-by-side\nelectronic and open outcry trading during the summer. Volatile trading in corn and wheat futures and options,\nwhere volume rose by 72 percent and 58 percent respectively to\nrecord highs, was another factor. CBOT's metals segment continued to expand sharply, with\naverage daily volume of 52,641 contracts in December up 332\npercent on the year. Shares in CBOT Holdings Inc. BOT.N, parent of the\nexchange, closed on Friday at $151.47, up 61.5 percent on the\nyear. CBOT shares peaked in November at $165.27, a few weeks\nafter the exchange's proposed merger with the Chicago\nMercantile Exchange was announced. If the merger was completed, CBOT Holdings would be merged\ninto Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. CME.N; the\ncombined company would be renamed CME Group Inc., with the CME\nand CBOT becoming subsidiaries.\n\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/cbot-volume-idUSN0232681320070102", "sectors": [["Bonds"]], "title": "update 1 - cbot volume up 40 pct in dec ., caps record year"},
{"date": "09:32 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " (The following was issued by Ormat Technologies (ORA.N), a\nunit of Israel's Ormat Industries ORMT.TA): Jan 2 - Ormat Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: ORA) today announced\nthat two of its subsidiaries have entered into Supply and\nEngineering, Procurement and Construction contracts with Ngawha\nGeneration Ltd., a subsidiary of Top Energy Limited (\"Top\nEnergy\") for a new geothermal power plant in Ngawha, New\nZealand. The contracts are for a total of approximately $20 million,\nwith construction of the power plant expected to be completed\nwithin 20 months from the contract date.  Top Energy is an\nenvironmentally friendly, local electricity network company in\nNew Zealand. This is the second order for an Ormat geothermal power plant\nfrom the company. Top Energy has been operating an Ormat 12 MW\ngeothermal power plant in Ngawha since June 1998.  Both plants will produce approximately 75 percent of the\nelectricity used by Top Energy's 26,000 consumers, thereby\nfurther reducing the amount of electricity, which would\notherwise be generated by scarce non-renewable resources that\nproduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions. Upon completion of the plant, the total installed capacity\nof Ormat's power plants in New Zealand will exceed 200 MW. The Ngawha plant contract is the tenth Ormat supply contract\nin New Zealand, six of which are repeat contracts for the supply\nof geothermal power plants in New Zealand. Lucien Y. Bronicki, Chairman of the Board and Chief\nTechnology Officer of Ormat Technologies, said, \"This contract\nbrings a new geothermal power plant to New Zealand and provides\nfurther confidence in Ormat's effectiveness and reliability. \"We are more than pleased with our progress over the past 25\nyears in New Zealand and remain confident that the efficient and\nsustainable use of geothermal resources, with its emission\nreduction and the prudent and modular development, will continue\nto attract medium and small developers such as medium size\nutilities, land owners and private investors, as well as the\ntraditional large utilities\". Mr. Bronicki continued, \"New Zealand is a significant\nresource for geothermal development, which we believe will\nprovide Ormat with additional growth opportunities that we look\nforward to developing.\" The new plant will optimize energy utilization by converting\nboth geothermal steam and brine from geothermal wells into\nelectric power energy. Unlike the flash steam turbine plants that deplete the\nresources by consuming water in the cooling towers, the new\nplant, as all existing Ormat plants in New Zealand will reinject\n100 percent of the geothermal fluid by using air-cooled\ncondensers. The 100 percent reinjection serves both to sustain the\nreservoir and to produce electrical power with virtually no\nenvironmental impact.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/ormat-ngawha-text-idUSL02513520070102", "sectors": [], "title": "text - ormat technologies gets new zealand power plant deal"},

{"date": "10:40 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "GAMBAGA, Ghana Jan 1 (Reuters Life!) - Mariama Alidu was cast out as a witch from her village by her own family, yet she swears she has never cast a spell.The mere suspicion of witchcraft was enough to see her and 80 other suspected witches expelled to a scruffy camp of mud huts on the fringes of the town of Gambaga in northern Ghana.\"It is the work of the devil. I can't say I have ever practiced it myself,\" says Mariama, who has lived in the camp for about 10 years.Hundreds more women accused of witchcraft live in similar camps in the cocoa- and gold-producing West African country.Belief in witchcraft remains widespread in Africa, the world's poorest continent, where Christianity and Islam rub shoulders with animist religions, and where witch doctors wield great power in tribal societies.In the poor, dry savannah of northern Ghana, the heat shimmers under a pale blue sky and allegations of witchcraft bubble up as readily as tar in the tropical heat.Like the witches' trials in Salem, Massachusetts, in 1692 or the Cold War persecution of alleged communists in 1950s America, the fate of a suspect often hangs on the word of another.Death, illness, dreams, superstition or even visible signs of success may be enough to provoke accusations of sorcery.No matter how hard the allegation is to prove -- or how hysterical the accuser -- the fact that witchcraft is virtually impossible to disprove means many women are forced to live outside their communities, some for as long as 30 years.Some are brought to the witch camps by their families. Others flee there from their homes and villages, fearing a beating or worse. Most of the occupants of the camps are women, although there are some men.Human rights campaigners say camp populations are declining, thanks to efforts by concerned agencies to reintegrate the women into society and fight the influence of witchcraft.\"People are becoming better aware that these issues are not just metaphysical but also a human rights issue,\" said Richard Quayson, deputy commissioner of the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ), Ghana's leading human rights organization.\"People don't tend to attack those who leave the camp and go back into society,\" he added.MALIGN FORCESYet a belief in malign spiritual forces remains strong in Ghana, especially in poor rural areas, and some say the camps will exist for many years to come.Mariama Alidu's own brother accused her of witchcraft, following an argument over her daughter's choice of fianc\u00e9e.When his own daughter fell ill, he blamed his sister and Mariama was taken to the Gambaga witch camp. At first, she thought she was just going on a trip. Only when she arrived did she realize where she was and what was happening.Gambaga's local chief, who lives in a larger mud hut than the others, requests money from visitors interested in meeting him and talking to the witches.\"In the olden days, when our forefathers were not yet born, when someone was suspected of being a witch, the fellow was killed. It is to eliminate this act of killing, that is why they are in the camp here,\" he said through an interpreter.\"If you have a witch in your community, you feel the witch is disturbing you. We can keep them here.\"The chief said the \"witches\" worked the fields with his wives, and in return he gave them food and shelter. Many also lived on charitable donations.PRICE OF SUCCESSFor many of these outcast women, their crime may be a quarrel with a daughter-in-law or simply that they have passed child-bearing age.In places where medical knowledge is scarce, illness is also often seen as having a spiritual or malignant cause.Even an elderly woman's appearance in a dream can be taken as a sign of her malevolent intent.In some cases, witchcraft offers an easy explanation as to why one person is successful and another is not.\"In cases where successful women, brilliant women, have gone beyond the confines of their status as women, witchcraft is used as an explanation,\" said Dr Abraham Akrong, of the University of Ghana's Institute of African Studies.His own mother, a successful businesswoman, feared buying land in case people attributed her success to witchcraft.Ironically, the rise in Ghana of charismatic Christian churches, with their focus on the fight against evil, has intensified fear and belief in witchcraft, even among educated people, Akrong said.For Alidu, the hut she shares with two others is likely to remain her home until her family is willing to take her back.Over the years, she has visited her children, who do not believe she is a witch. Too old to work on the chief's farm, she relies on food brought to her by other residents.Asked if she is angry with the brother who cast her out, she said: \"We were born of the same woman. I don't understand why he should accuse me of being a witch when our mother wasn't a witch.\"", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-ghana-witches-idUSL2159547520070102", "sectors": [["Oddly Enough"]], "title": "alleged african witches still outcast to camps"},

He had been in prison,\" said Benavente de Blas. \"Bernui didn't hesitate to use violence against the residents in bars, drove his car wherever he liked and did whatever he felt like.\"On December 23, Bernui entered a bar, thumping the bar and pushing other customers aside. A man told Bernui enough was enough and gave him a beating.Bernui responded by returning a week later with a number of friends to destroy the bar.The attack was the last straw for some 200 of Villaconejos's 3,400 residents, who went to Bernui's house later that day. Civil Guard police contained the crowd and arrested Bernui when he fired two shots, one at the ground and another into the air.But 400 villagers returned the next day, setting fire to Bernui's home, garage, two cars, a van, two quad bikes and a motorbike and blocking the path of firefighters.Three elderly people and a pregnant woman were at Bernui's home but were evacuated by police and no one was hurt.\"It was all of us.

All I want is to find out how my son is but I don't know how I can do it,\" Malawi's Daily Times newspaper quoted Yohane Banda as saying.\"I only talked to her once at the High Court and I want to talk to her now and find out about my child.\"The father of one-year-old David Banda made the comments after the newspaper presented him with a 400 pound ($788) check from Scottish nun, Christine Webster, who told the paper she believes Banda would have been better off staying in Malawi.Madonna's adoption of the child grabbed world headlines and caused some rights groups in Malawi to question whether she had used her celebrity to bypass laws governing the adoption of Malawians by foreigners.Madonna signed interim adoption papers when she and her husband, film maker Guy Ritchie, visited in October on what they said was a humanitarian mission to help Malawi orphans.Under the interim order, the child was to stay with Madonna for 18 months during which time his progress would be monitored by Malawian officials before deciding whether final approval may be given for him to remain with her family.The High Court order angered human rights groups who described it as illegal and took the issue to court.The high court has since granted the advocacy groups an application to be part of the adoption proceedings of Madonna, a move which offered some relief for her as it did not amount to a green light for the rights groups to mount a full challenge against the adoption.The controversy over Madonna's adoption of the boy has helped to spotlight the plight of orphans in Malawi.Over 900,000 children in Malawi are orphaned and another 500,000 have lost at least one parent.Banda dismissed any suggestions that he wants the child back and asked human rights groups not to interfere in his attempts to speak with Madonna.\"All I want is to find out how my child is doing and not to have him back,\" he was quoted as saying.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-malawi-madonna-father-idUSL021560920070102", "sectors": [["Entertainment, ", "People"]], "title": "father of boy adopted by madonna wants news of him"},

But that evaporated against the Ethiopian military.\"They realized they were not capable of resisting this sophisticated machine. That is the story of war throughout history. Ideology is not enough to get you through when you are being smashed militarily,\" the military expert said.But hardcore militants in the SICC's ranks, whom the United States and United Nations say have links to al Qaeda, may plan to return to the kind of insurgency they practiced in Somalia in limited instances before the rise of the SICC.Most experts say there is a risk the remaining fighters, especially those with training in bombings, assassinations and sniping, will go underground and use their skills in Ethiopia, Somalia and even Kenya.\"You don't go up against tanks and jets and helicopters if you don't have an offset to them. But there is a greater plan, and we're just waiting for the rubber band to snap back,\" said a security expert who declined to be named.The Ethiopian army, one of the strongest in Africa, appears intent on flushing out the last SICC fighters, chasing them to hideouts in Ras Kamboni on the coast and in the desert as they head for the Kenyan border.Kenya is trying to seal its lengthy and porous frontier.Intelligence sources say Kenya has also beefed up ground and sea patrols, and the United States is providing surveillance to help capture three fighters believed in the SICC ranks who are on lists of wanted terrorists.\"This is going to be the final fight.

Of these, 64 percent were binge-drinkers.And the binge drinkers were not simply experimenting -- 69 percent reported having done so more than once in the past 30 days.Teen drinkers in general were more than twice as likely to be sexually active as non-drinkers, the researchers found.They were more than four times as likely to smoke cigarettes and more than twice as likely to have been in a physical fight, the researchers found. These rates went up even higher for binge drinkers, they reported.The binge drinkers were more than five times as likely as non-drinkers to be sexually active, more than 18 times as likely to smoke cigarettes, and more than four times as likely to have been in a physical fight. They were also far more likely to smoke marijuana and attempt suicide, the researchers said.Drinkers also did more poorly in school, according to the survey.Among other  studies on teenage alcohol use, in September the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration found that 16.5 percent of 12- to 17-year-olds admitted to drinking.

Volume was light during a session shortened for a day of\nmourning to honor former U.S. President Gerald Ford. Many\ntrading desks were thinly staffed as financial markets were\neither closed or open only for a half-session on Tuesday, when\nthe United States holds a national funeral service for the\nformer president. That leaves Tuesday virtually devoid of economic data for\nbond investors. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM)\nmanufacturing report on Wednesday and the monthly nonfarm\npayrolls report, due on Friday could be major catalysts for the\nTreasury market. \"This is that sort of bounce that you get after the\npounding the bond market took last week,\" said Kevin Flanagan,\nfixed income strategist for global wealth management with\nMorgan Stanley in Purchase, New York. \"I wouldn't read too much\ninto it and we are still at a kind of half staffed situation,\"\nFlanagan said. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR were up 1/32 in price\nfor a yield of 4.69 percent, versus 4.70 percent late on\nFriday. Markets had been closed on Monday for the New Year's\nDay public holiday. \"For the week, the big number will be the employment report\non Friday,\" said Don Kowalchik, a debt strategist at A.G.\nEdwards & Sons in St. Louis. If the jobs data surprises, the\n10-year Treasury note's yield could test the upper or lower\nlimits of its near term range, around 4.75 percent and 4.50\npercent, Kowalchik said. Two-year notes US2YT=RR, which respond closely to\nexpectations for Federal Reserve interest rate moves, rose 2/32\nin price to yield 4.80 percent, compared with 4.82 percent on\nFriday. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association\nhas recommended an early bond market close at 2 p.m. (1900 GMT)\nand the key manufacturing report of the week, the Institute for\nSupply Management (ISM) index, has been rescheduled for\nWednesday.

Last week, stronger-than-expected U.S. economic reports on\nhome sales, consumer confidence and Chicago manufacturing\nweighed on bond prices as prospects of a Federal Reserve\ninterest rate cut early this year appeared to dwindle. \"The November data, at least, reinforces the idea the Fed's\non hold,\" wrote David Ader, head of government bond strategy\nwith RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut in a daily\nresearch note.

AL.TO (AL.N) said\non Tuesday that a British Columbia regulator's rejection of a\npower-sale agreement could affect plans for a $1.8 billion\nexpansion of its aluminum smelter at Kitimat. Alcan, the world's second-largest maker of primary\naluminum, said the British Columbia Utilities Commission\nrejected a proposed long-term energy agreement that would see\nthe company sell electricity from its Kitimat-area power plant\nto provincially owned utility BC Hydro. \"We are disappointed with the BCUC decision and will be\nstudying it closely to better understand the commission's\nrationale and to determine the potential impact on the\nfeasibility and timing of the Kitimat modernization project,\"\nMichel Jacques, president and chief executive of Alcan Primary\nMetal Group, said in a statement. Approval of the power contract was one of three conditions\nAlcan set for the modernization of Kitimat, in northwestern\nBritish Columbia. The plans would expand the smelter's annual\nproduction capacity by more than 60 percent to about 400,000\ntonnes from 245,000 tonnes. The other two conditions to be met were environmental\npermits and a labor agreement with the Canadian Auto Workers\nunion, which represents Kitimat workers. In a letter on Friday, the commission said the power pact\nshould not be accepted, in part because of prices BC Hydro\nwould have to pay for excess energy supplied by Alcan's Kemano\nhydro-electric plant near the Kitimat site. The commission said it would release the reasons for its\ndecision at a later date. In arguments at the commission, BC Hydro had said the power\nagreement with Alcan would help the utility meets its goal of\nenergy self-sufficiency. But others told the commission that Alcan should use all\nthe power generated at Kemano to produce aluminum at Kitimat\nrather than divert it for sale through the province's power\ngrid. When Alcan unveiled the Kitimat project in mid-August, the\ncompany said the smelter expansion would increase its global\naluminum output by more than 4 percent. Using an upgraded version of the AP smelting technology it\nacquired when it bought France's Pechiney in 2004, the first\npart of the new capacity was slated to come on stream in 2009. Alcan shares were off 8 Canadian cents at C$56.70 on the\nToronto Stock Exchange on Tuesday morning.

{"date": "12:35 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "NEW YORK Jan 2 The number of U.S. securities\nfraud class-action lawsuits dropped last year, a study released\non Tuesday found, even as investors pursued a new avenue of\nlitigation involving the timing of stock options grants at big\ncompanies. Federal securities fraud class-actions plunged 38 percent\nto 110 last year based on filings through Dec. 11, compared\nwith 178 lawsuits in 2005 and as many as 267 in 2002, according\nto a study by Stanford Law School and Cornerstone Research, a\nresearch firm for litigators. Filings are at the lowest level since Congress passed a\nmajor class-action reform law in 1995, the study said. The declines come even as a new area emerged for investor\nlawsuits -- fraud cases related to options awarded to top\ncorporate executives. Twenty options-related lawsuits were\nfiled in 2006 against companies such as Apple Computer Inc.\n(AAPL.O), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH.N) and Juniper Networks\nJNPR.O. There is no single reason for the overall drop, but\nincreased corporate enforcement activity by the U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission and the Justice Department is a likely\nexplanation, said Stanford law professor Joseph Grundfest. \"One explanation is that there is simply less fraud in the\nmarket,\" he said. The stock market also has been strong\nrecently, though \"it will take us several years to figure out\nwhether that is really the cause of the decline,\" he added. The report comes as class-action lawyers are under heavy\nfire from business interest groups and politicians who argue\nthat shareholder litigation is growing out of control. Class-action lawyers have been dealt some big blows,\nincluding a December ruling by a federal appeals court that\nsaid 12 securities firms will not have to face a class-action\nsuit accusing them of manipulating the pricing of initial\npublic offerings in the late 1990s. The report released on Tuesday found that when class-action\nsuits are filed, the dollar amounts are often smaller than they\nwere in prior years. Alleged investor losses, measured by stock\nmarket declines at the time the fraud allegations were\ndisclosed, fell 44 percent to $52 billion in 2006, from $93\nbillion in 2005. Proponents of class-action reform say the report shows no\nevidence that the trends are here to stay. In a statement, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said that\n\"although we applaud the decrease in filings, there is still a\nlong way to go to fix a broken securities litigation system, in\nwhich shareholders basically end up suing themselves with the\nlawyers raking huge sums off the top.\" Separately on Tuesday, a survey of large U.S. companies\nfrom BTI Consulting Group found that these businesses spent\n$56.4 billion on outside counsel last year, up 19.6 percent\nfrom 2005. The Chamber of Commerce said the fall-off in lawsuits can\npartially be attributed to the travails of once dominant\nclass-action litigation firm Milberg Weiss Bershad & Schulman\nLLP, which was indicted in May on criminal charges that it paid\nkickbacks to plaintiffs. Milberg, which has denied the charges, filed 73 fewer cases\nin 2006 than in 2005, according to the Chamber of Commerce. But the study from Stanford and Cornerstone said the\nMilberg indictment probably had no big impact on the overall\ndecline in class-action lawsuits. \"There is no shortage of plaintiffs' lawyers in the United\nStates and there are no barriers to entry,\" Grundfest said.\n\"All of the lawyers that know how to file these cases are still\nin business.\"\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/law-classactions-idUSN0231990320070102", "sectors": [["Regulatory News, ", "Bonds"]], "title": "u . s . securities fraud cases down sharply - study"},

U.S. stock and commodity markets were shut to mark the\ndeath of former President Gerald Ford. Trading sessions on the\nforeign exchange and government bond markets were shortened in\nhonor of Ford. Normal trading will resume on Wednesday. A narrowing yield advantage for the dollar has seen\ninvestors shunning the greenback. On Tuesday, the dollar's\nlosses were more pronounced against European currencies such as\nthe euro, sterling and the Swedish crown, where central banks\nare seen as likely to keep raising interest rates in 2007. \"The dollar is picking up where it left off last year, and\nthat's under pressure,\" said Alex Beuzelin, senior market\nanalyst at Ruesch International in Washington. \"The heart of the dollar's woes continues to be that its\nyield advantage is going to keep eroding over time as the Fed\nholds steady or starts cutting rates.\" Analysts expect the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates\nsteady in the early part of 2007 and probably start cutting by\nthe second half of the year. The central bank tightened monetary policy 17 times between\nJune 2004 and June 2006, taking the fed funds rate to 5.25\npercent. The euro EUR= was up 0.65 percent at $1.3285 as of midday\nin New York trade, adding to an 11.5 percent gain against the\ndollar in 2006, its best performance in three years. The dollar\nwas down 0.2 percent against the yen at 118.80 yen. TREASURIES POST MODEST GAINS U.S government bonds booked modest gains in light volumes\nafter last week's beating on the back of surprisingly robust\neconomic data. \"This is that sort of bounce that you get after the\npounding the bond market took last week,\" said Kevin Flanagan,\nfixed income strategist for global wealth management with\nMorgan Stanley in Purchase, New York. \"I wouldn't read too much into it and we are still at a\nkind of half staffed situation,\" Flanagan said. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR were up 2/32 in price\nfor a yield of 4.69 percent, versus 4.70 percent late on\nFriday. Markets were closed on Monday for the New Year's Day\npublic holiday. EUROPEAN SHARES SIZZLE While U.S. stock markets were closed, European shares\njumped to their highest level in almost six years, buoyed by\ngains in mining stocks on stronger gold prices and renewed\noptimism about demand for base metals, while ongoing merger\nspeculation lent support in the first session of the new year. Among the biggest gainers, Germany's Metro (MEOG.DE)\nrallied despite a major shareholder denying talk it was buying\nshares on the market, while Vodafone (VOD.L) rose after a\nreport suggested the mobile giant was less likely to acquire\nIndia's Hutchison Essar. The FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top European shares\nclosed up 18.36 points at 1,501.83 points, its highest level\nsince February 2001.

{"date": "12:49 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " (Adds comments from Citigroup, RLPC loan figures) By Quentin WebbLONDON Jan 2 (Reuters) - A merger boom and low borrowing\ncosts helped push global debt issuance to a record $6.9 trillion\nin 2006, data from Thomson Financial showed on Tuesday. The blizzard of debt deals -- up 13 percent from 2005 --\nhelped banks to enjoy a 26 percent rise in underwriting fees to\n$23.9 billion, according to calculations for Thomson by M&A\nconsultants Freeman & Co. Thomson said a 55 percent jump in global high-yield debt\nissuance and increases of more than a quarter in global\ninvestment-grade and emerging markets debt sales had helped fuel\nthe overall rise. \"These sectors have benefited from a record-breaking merger\nmarket, robust financing activity across many industries and\nhistorically low interest rates,\" Thomson said in a report. Thomson data showed global mergers and acquisitions hit a\nrecord $3.8 trillion in 2006, helped by a surge in\nprivate-equity led leveraged buyouts (LBOs), to make up 19.9\npercent of deals. Structured finance flourished, particularly issuance of\ncollateralised debt obligations (CDOs), which repackage credit\nrisk from bonds, leveraged loans, and other debt securities.\nGlobal CDO sales doubled to $452 billion. \"There is a lot of money flowing round the system, seeking\nyield and investment, and that's what's driving record figures,\"\nsaid Charlie Berman, Citigroup's co-head of fixed income capital\nmarkets in Europe. \"The distinctive feature this year has been the tremendous\namount of activity in terms of the leveraged markets,\" Berman\nadded. \"We've seen extraordinary activity in the LBO (leveraged\nbuyout) market, and all sorts of high-yield (deals), and\ntransaction sizes which are much more akin to investment\ngrade-sized financings.\"\n STAGGERING INCREASE Thomson said global high-yield debt issuance hit $187\nbillion, swelled by a \"staggering\" 127 percent increase in deals\nto fund LBOs, including the three largest high-yield deals ever\n-- from Freescale Semiconductor Inc, NXP Semiconductors and U.S.\nhospital operator HCA Inc. \"The rule has always been 'high-yield, high-margin, low\nvolumes', but that hasn't been the case this year,\" Berman said. It was a good year for Citigroup (C.N), which kept its No. 1\nposition as global debt bookrunner; JP Morgan (JPM.N), which\nmoved to second from fourth in the global debt bookrunner table;\nand Barclays Capital (BARC.L), which leapt to seventh place from\n11th a year ago. But Lehman Brothers LEH.N and Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) both\nslipped two places, to fourth and eighth place respectively. However, Freeman & Co's \"imputed fees,\" which estimate\nunpublished fees using the consultancy's own algorithms,\nsuggested some banks had reaped the benefits of concentrating on\nhigher-margin work. Merrill Lynch MER.N, the top adviser on lucrative CDO\ndeals, ranked 6th by global debt volumes but second only to\nCitigroup by imputed fees, earning an estimated $1.51 billion. In the loan market, preliminary data from Reuters Loan\nPricing Corp. (RLPC) suggests global syndicated loan volume is\nalso on track to eclipse last year's record issuance of $3.2\ntrillion, due largely to M&A, which has boosted volumes in the\nUnited States and Asia, while Europe has maintained its pace.\n (Additional reporting by Tessa Walsh of RLPC)\n\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/debt-thomson-idUSL0235795820070102", "sectors": [["Bonds, ", "IPOs"]], "title": "update 1 - global debt sales at record $ 6 . 9 tln in 06 - thomson"},

'I love Michael.' He said, 'Tell him don't worry about coming home. They always scandalize those that have the talent.

The next year he unveiled his signature \"moonwalk\" -- a dance move similar to one of Brown's -- while performing \"Billie Jean\" during an NBC special.Since the molestation case ended, Jackson has spent time in Bahrain, Ireland and France and has said he planned to move to Europe in a bid to resurrect his career.

(MMC.N) has agreed in principle to sell its\nPutnam Investments unit to Power Corp. of Canada (POW.TO) for $3.9\nbillion, according to sources familiar with the situation. A Putnam spokeswoman and a spokesman for Marsh & McLennan\ndeclined to comment. A representative for Montreal-based Power\nCorp., also a financial services company, did not return a call\nseeking comment. While the companies have reached agreement, the deal is not\nexpected to be announced immediately because final details still\nneed to be settled, one of the sources said. March & McLennan put Putnam, its asset management unit, on the\nblock in September, and Marsh & McLennan Chief Executive Michael\nCherkasky said in December that he would decide whether to sell\nthe unit by early 2007. The Putnam mutual fund board of directors is due to meet in\nthe second week of January. Putnam, once the country's fifth-largest mutual fund firm and\na star during the Internet boom of the 1990s, has run into\nproblems after being caught up in the mutual fund industry trading\nscandal three years ago. Investors have pulled money out and the\nperformance of its top fund is lagging many of its peers. Its flagship Voyager fund, which invests in large growth\nstocks, rose 5.2 percent in 2006, trailing the S&P 500's .SPX\ngains of 13.6 percent. Putnam's assets overall have shrunk by\nabout a third over the last three years to $191 billion. Still, buyers were interested in Putnam. The Wall Street\nJournal, which first reported last week that a deal had been\nreached, had previously reported that bidders for Putnam included\nPower Corp., Italian bank UniCredito Italiano SpA (CRDI.MI) and\nLondon-based fund manager Amvescap Plc AVZ.L, parent of Aim\nTrimark. Ownership of Putnam would give Power Corp. a new\nmoney-management platform in the United States. The company,\nfounded in 1925 to profit from the growing demand for electricity,\nis controlled by Canada's wealthy and well-connected Desmarais\nfamily and has grown far beyond its early hydroelectric roots. Power Corp. holds 66.4 percent of Power Financial Corp.\n(PWF.TO), which controls insurer Great-West Lifeco Inc. (GWO.TO)\nand IGM Financial Inc. (IGM.TO). The financial unit also owns half\nthe company that controls European investment firm Pargesa Holding\nSA (PARG.S). Winnipeg, Manitoba-based IGM Financial has C$104.1 billion in\nassets under management, mainly in its Investors Group Inc. and\nMackenzie Financial Corp. fund families.

House prices in England and Wales rose 0.6 percent on the\nmonth in November and 6.8 percent year-on-year, according to\nLand Registry data. The banking sector was boosted by the data because it showed\ncontinued growth in the UK housing market, benefiting mortgage\ndemand, traders said. Barclays (BARC.L) and Royal Bank of\nScotland (RBS.L) both added 2.1 percent.

They finished 5-11 and were essentially out of the playoff hunt by mid-season.\"For me, during the time I have been with the Redskins this season was most disappointing,\" Gibbs said. \"Last year we played extremely well down the stretch even though we lost some guys.\"I thought for us to make the playoffs last year was a step forward for the franchise.

{"date": "21:31 01 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " NEW YORK (Billboard) - Following are previews of albums due \nout within the next few months from debut acts or \nunder-the-radar artists due for a breakthrough.\n PAOLO NUTINI Scottish singer/songwriter Paolo Nutini, who turns 20 \nJanuary 9, was one of the most noteworthy breakout artists of \n2006 for Atlantic Records in the United Kingdom. After an \nappearance at South by Southwest in Austin last March, his \ndebut single, \"Last Request,\" reached No. 5 in July on the \nBritish charts and also became a substantial airplay hit. His debut album, \"These Streets,\" subsequently opened at \nNo. 3 with out-of-the-box sales of 35,000, according to his \nlabel, which had risen to 500,000 by December. A second single, \"Jenny Don't Be Hasty,\" was a top 20 U.K. \nhit in early October and was followed in early December by \n\"Rewind.\" As \"New Shoes,\" his first U.S. radio track, made inroads at \nthe triple-A format late in the year, Atlantic was developing \nits transatlantic plans for Nutini for 2007. \"These Streets\" is \ndue for U.S. release January 30, when he performs on \"Today,\" \nwith a booking for \"Late Night With Conan O'Brien\" the \nfollowing day.\n JAMES MORRISON His name may have a familiar ring for U.S. audiences. And \nby the early part of 2007, American radio listeners and record \nbuyers are expected to recognize James Morrison's music. One of the big breakout success stories in the United \nKingdom in 2006, the Polydor-signed artist is tipped for big \nthings abroad. Soundwise, think James Blunt, with an edge. Interscope is setting up the smoky-toned singer's debut \nalbum, \"Undiscovered,\" for U.S. release in first-quarter 2007, \nat which time Morrison will head Stateside to do promotional \nand support work. The album has shipped more than 1 million copies worldwide \nsince its August release, more than half of those tallied in \nthe United Kingdom.\n YOUNG LOVE Last year, Young Love -- a.k.a. Dan Keyes, former frontman \nof Texas rock band Recover -- was busing tables and working at \nAmerican Apparel in New York, casually carting a demo of \ndance-rock tunes from one hipster club to the next. DJs dug them, especially the Bloc Party-meets-Blur \n\"Discotech,\" a guitar-laden ode to boogie-ing in the Big Apple \nthat is so joyful and unpretentious that it had to be written \nby an out-of-towner. Then Jay-Z called. \"This is where it's at,\" Jay-Z told Keyes over brunch in \nMiami, as Beyonce lounged by the pool and paparazzi helicopters \ncircled. So Keyes signed with Island Def Jam and took his demos into \nthe studio. Keyes himself resembles the shaggy teen hero, fair and \nlanky with an intense gray-eyed stare. \"A friend gave me Daft \nPunk's 'Discovery' for Christmas a couple of years ago, and it \nkind of destroyed my rock band,\" he says. \"I didn't want to \nplay guitar anymore, so I started experimenting with electronic \nstuff.\"\n THE PONYS The Ponys' first full-length album on esteemed indie \nMatador Records doesn't arrive until March 20. But judging from the Chicago-based rock band's previous \nwork, its Matador debut, \"Turn the Lights Out,\" should be worth \nthe wait. The act's 2005 disc, \"Celebration Castle,\" released on Los \nAngeles-based garage rock label In the Red, has sold 7,000 \nunits in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. \"Celebration Castle\" matched a hard-rock intensity with a \nhung-over swagger, and the Ponys established themselves as one \nof the most exciting bands in underground rock. From the bluesy breakdown in shout-along anthem \"Get Black\" \nto the slacker wailing of frontman/guitarist Jered Gummere in \nthe punk-rock strut of \"Today,\" \"Celebration Castle\" flirted \nwith recklessness as its tightly structured songs burst with \npop hooks. The band is also confident enough to slow things down and \nshow off some new wave influences (see the Cure-like \"We Shot \nthe World\"). In the Red has given Matador a solid base to build \nupon in further boosting the Ponys' career.\n LEDISI R&B's underground cognoscenti have carried a torch for this \nspirited singer/songwriter since 1996. Folks still wax \nrhapsodic over Ledisi's \"Soulsinger,\" her 1998 indie debut, \naccompanied by former partner and keyboardist Sundra Manning. Now a solo artist, Ledisi is a rare but welcome commodity: \nWhat you hear on record is what you get live. Mixing R&B, jazz, \ngospel, pop and rock with flavorful scatting, Ledisi's \nenergetic live gigs are can't-miss propositions. Two years ago, this Oakland, Calif., talent offered an \narresting interpretation of Luther Vandross' \"My Sensitivity\" \nthat gained some national airplay, as well as the attention of \nVerve Records. Now Ledisi's sassy vocals (think Minnie Riperton meets \nSarah Vaughan) are poised to reach a wider arena this spring \nwith the release of her Verve debut. A fitting scenario, given \nthat Ledisi's name means \"to come forth\" in Nigerian. Ledisi still isn't leaving anything to chance. She \ncontinues to operate her label, LeSun Music, and owns her \nmasters.\n LUKE BRYAN Luke Bryan is unapologetically country in his music and \nlifestyle, which is why he stands out from the pack. \"Even my friends in Nashville laugh sometimes at how \ncountry I am,\" he says. \"I'm still adjusting to (living in \nNashville) because I can't . . . just walk out my door and go \nfishing or hunting or do something outdoors.\" A native of Leesburg, Ga., Bryan grew up on his family's \npeanut farm. With lyrics like \"I can grow my own groceries and salt-cure \na ham/Hey baby, I'm a country man\" and a stone-country \npresentation, Bryan is hatched from the same mold as Randy \nTravis and Alan Jackson. First single \"All My Friends Say\" is due at radio in \nFebruary, and an album will follow in summer. Bryan co-wrote \nall 11 songs on his Capitol Records Nashville debut and also \nco-wrote Billy Currington's current single \"Good Directions.\" In an effort to build consumer awareness, Capitol made a \nfour-song EP and individual tracks available on iTunes in late \nOctober.\n NAOMI STRIEMER Fans of purely melodic pop music should rejoice. Naomi \nStriemer is here to offer what they crave. The singer/songwriter, whose debut album \"Images\" arrived \nin December on S Records, was home-schooled in her native Nova \nScotia, Canada, but she realized she had a purpose far from the \nfarm. \"Thinking back to where I come from and enjoying the \ninnocence of life's untouched imagination, I dreamt of being \nsomething that seemed so far out of reach but so close in my \nmind,\" Striemer says. As a teen, she signed with Epic Records, but the deal \nunraveled when then-president Polly Anthony exited. Then Steven Nowack, a hedge-fund driver, saw Striemer \nperform live in Toronto, and approached the artist and asked, \n\"What are you doing for the rest of your life?\" He formed S \nRecords as a vehicle to launch her. Her album's first single, the melancholy ballad \"Cars,\" \nproduced by Narada Michael Walden and featuring a guitar solo \nby Carlos Santana, gained coverage from Fox News columnist \nRoger Friedman and the National Post in Canada. \"I am a testament that it doesn't matter where you come \nfrom or how badly the world tears you down,\" Striemer says. \"If \nyou believe, life, love and God will get you through.\"\n JOHN WALLER When one of country music's veteran hitmakers and one of \nthe Christian community's most successful artists team up to \nintroduce a new act, expectations run high. And \nsinger/songwriter John Waller meets and exceeds those \nexpectations with thoughtful songwriting and a compelling \nvoice. The former frontman for acclaimed indie band According to \nJohn, Waller returns on Beach Street Records, a Christian label \nowned by Sawyer Brown's Mark Miller. Mark Hall, leader of Beach \nStreet's flagship act Casting Crowns, introduced Miller to \nWaller's music. Hall met Waller at a youth rally shortly after \nSeptember 11, 2001, and recalls being immediately impressed \nwith Waller's songwriting. \"Then he started talking between the songs, and something \nstood out about him,\" Hall says. \"I could tell he was reaching \nmy students.\" After his earlier band broke up, Waller moved to Colorado \nto become a worship pastor. During a trip to Atlanta, he \nenlisted Hall to sing on a song called \"The Blessing.\" Hall sent a CD to Miller, who signed Waller to Beach \nStreet. The label is working \"The Blessing\" at Christian radio \nas the first single from Waller's debut album, set to arrive \nMarch 6.\n K-OS Toronto-bred MC Kheaven Brereton, aka K-OS, has been making \nwaves in Canada and beyond since his 2002 debut album, \"Exit.\" \nBut he's poised to finally infiltrate the United States in 2007 \nwith \"Atlantis: Hymns for Disco,\" which will be worked here by \nVirgin. K-OS' two prior albums were released in the States by \nAstralwerks. In Canada, the genre-bending \"Atlantis\" debuted in October \nat No. 5 on the album chart, the highest debut by any Canadian \nurban artist in Nielsen SoundScan history, Virgin says. In the States, the album's first single is the infectious \n\"Sunday Morning,\" which many are likening to OutKast's \"Hey \nYa!\" or Gnarls Barkley's \"Crazy.\" Ahead of the album's February 20 U.S. release, \"Sunday \nMorning\" is already benefiting from airplay at NASCAR, NFL and \nNCAA events and on ESPN's \"NFL Sunday Morning Countdown.\"\n RICH BOY Rich Boy, a.k.a. Maurice Richards, is catching everyone's \nears with his single \"Throw Some D's,\" which samples Switch's \n\"I Call Your Name.\" Working with producers Butta and Polow Da Don (known for \ntheir tracks with the Pussycat Dolls and Fergie of the Black \nEyed Peas), Rich Boy is cooking up debut album \"A Product of \nthe Hustle\" for release early this year. A native of Mobile, Ala., Rich Boy began as a student at \nhistorically black college Tuskegee University before he \ndropped out to pursue music. Thinking he'd make it as a producer instead of mechanical \nengineer, his original major, he wrote the track \"Cold As Ice,\" \nwhich garnered local radio support. After meeting Polow in 2003, Rich Boy later signed with \nInterscope and began his artist-development process. Now \"Throw \nSome D's\" is also garnering strong support at national radio. In addition, MTV profiled Rich on its up-and-coming artists \nseries, \"You Hear It First.\" And realizing hip-hop's high \nturnover rate, Rich Boy is rejuvenating \"Throw Some D's\" with a \nsoon-to-be-released remix featuring the Game, Jim Jones and \nOutKast's Andre 3000.

{"date": "22:58 01 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " NEW YORK (Billboard) - Billboard presents a look at the \nmusic you'll be hearing a lot about in the first quarter:\n JOHN MELLENCAMP \"Freedom's Road\" (Universal, January 23) Mellencamp's first album of originals since 2001 is led by \n\"Our Country,\" which has been prominently featured in a \nChevrolet commercial to the chagrin of his label. In November, \nthe track earned Mellencamp his first appearance on The \nBillboard Hot 100 in nine years and just the third of his \ncareer on Hot Country Songs. \"'Our Country' is the most John Mellencamp-sounding record \non it,\" he says. \"I think people are gonna go, 'Wow!,' or \nthey're gonna go, 'What is he trying to do?\"' Elsewhere, Joan \nBaez duets with Mellencamp on the track \"Jim Crow.\"\n THE SHINS \"Wincing the Night Away\" (Sub Pop, January 23) Natalie Portman's character in the 2004 film \"Garden State\" \nproclaimed \"the Shins will change your life,\" which the \nPortland, Ore., indie-pop darlings hope to do with their third \nSub Pop album, originally due last summer. \"I'm constantly reminded of how much better the project \ngets as new discoveries are made,\" frontman James Mercer says. \n\"That only happens through taking your time and being able to \napproach it with some new perspective.\" Indeed, \"Wincing\" advances the band well beyond the simple \nindie pop of its first two albums, the most recent of which, \n2003's \"Chutes Too Narrow,\" has sold 407,000 copies in the \nUnited States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Highlights include \"Turn on Me,\" which nearly nicks the \nmelody of the girl-group classic \"Then He Kissed Me\"; \"Black \nWave,\" a ghostly slice of acoustic folk that never releases its \ntension; and the jammed-out opener \"Sleeping Lessons.\"\n NORAH JONES \"Not Too Late\" (Blue Note, January 30) Norah Jones kept a low profile in 2006, recording a \ncollaborative album with New York-based musician friends as the \nLittle Willies and guesting on the self-titled Ipecac album \nfrom Mike Patton's Peeping Tom project. But January 30 sees her back in the public eye with her \nthird album, \"Not Too Late,\" comprising songs all written or \nco-written by the artist. Production was handled by Jones' \nsongwriting partner/bassist Lee Alexander; indie \nsinger/songwriter M. Ward, Kronos Quartet cellist Jeff Ziegler \nand organist Larry Goldings make guest appearances. First single \"Thinking About You\" typifies an album full of \njazz- and soul-shaded arrangements, old-school organ and horns \nand Jones' honeyed vocals. KATHARINE McPHEE Title TBA (RCA, January 30) McPhee rushed off the road with the American Idols summer \ntour to build songs from scratch with such collaborators as \nTimbaland associate Nate Hill, Babyface, Kara DioGuardi and \nRyan Leslie. \"It's rhythm pop,\" she says of the album's sound. \n\"It's not like really R&B or really poppy, but there are a \ncouple of tracks that are really good for the 'American Idol' \nfans who voted for me and knew me as the 'Over the Rainbow' \ngirl.\"\n CLAP YOUR HANDS SAY YEAH Some Loud Thunder (self-released, January 30) The indie-rock darlings headed to upstate New York to \nrecord their second album with producer Dave Fridmann. Like the \nband's 2005 self-titled debut, \"Thunder\" will bypass a label \nand be worked directly through the Alternative Distribution \nAlliance. Look for plenty of what the Talking Heads-influenced \nrock bloggers have come to love, particularly the danceable \ntitle track.\n FALL OUT BOY Infinity on High (Island, February 6) Fall Out Boy thinks its third album will surprise its fans \n-- but hopefully in a good way. Vocalist/guitarist Patrick \nStump says the Chicago band's second major label set, the \nfollow-up to 2005's double-platinum \"From Under the Cork Tree,\" \ncuts a broader swath than its predecessors. \"From song to song there's a completely different feel, but \nthey all make sense in context,\" he says. \"They've got a few \ncommon points, but overall there's a lot of different voices \nand perspectives and styles. It would be dishonest for us to \nhold back any of these elements.\" As for the funky single \"This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms \nRace,\" Stump enthuses, \"It's basically a hip-hop/R&B song but \nwritten as a punk song.\"\n LUCINDA WILLIAMS West (Lost Highway, February 13) Loss and loneliness are at the core of Lucinda Williams' \neighth album, which finds her coping with another painful \nbreakup and the passing of her mother, about whom she \nreminisces in songs like \"Mama You Sweet\" and \"Fancy Funeral.\" \nWilliams says, \"It's probably been the most prolific time in my \nlife as a writer. I'd been through so many changes, so \nobviously there's a lot of pain and struggling, but it ends \nwith a look toward the future.\"\n CHARLIE LOUVIN Charlie Louvin (Tompkins Square, February 20) Wilco's Jeff Tweedy, Elvis Costello and George Jones are \namong the artists pitching in on country legend Louvin's first \nnew album in more than a decade. The artist, who turns 80 in \nJuly, also netted contributions from Will Oldham, Tom T. Hall, \nBobby Bare Sr., Marty Stuart, the Clean's David Kilgour and \nmembers of Lambchop, Superchunk, Bright Eyes and Clem Snide.\n LIL JON Crunk Rock (TVT, date TBA) Lil Jon is hard at work on \"Crunk Rock,\" for which the \nAtlanta producer is hoping to collaborate with Rick Rubin, Good \nCharlotte, Korn's Jonathan Davis and Green Day producer Rob \nCavallo. \"I ain't trying to save the world, and I ain't trying to \nreinvent the wheel,\" he says. \"I'm a give people what they know \nand love me for -- the crunk s--- and the nice club records for \nthe ladies to dance to. But also on this record, I've got live \nbands, crazy heavy metal and rock guitars, so it's a mixture.\" The track \"Act the Fool\" featuring Three 6 Mafia was \nrecently leaked on Jon's MySpace page.\n MODEST MOUSE We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank (Epic, date TBA) Modest Mouse reached previously unknown commercial heights \nwith 2004's \"Good News for People Who Love Bad News\" and its \nubiquitous hit \"Float On.\" But there are no mainstream-courting \nmaneuvers on its third Epic album, which introduces former \nSmiths guitarist Johnny Marr into the fold. Album opener/first single \"Dashboard\" rides in on a boogie \nriff and thudding kick drum, while \"Florida\" is a tight rocker \nwith a prominent hook and \"Fire It Up\" conjures vintage Modest \nMouse melancholy. But the best of the bunch is the \neight-minute-plus \"Spitting Venom,\" which blooms from a sleepy \nacoustic intro into a full-on psychedelic jam. The Shins' James \nMercer sings backup on three cuts.\n THE ARCADE FIRE Neon Bible (Merge, March 6) The Arcade Fire's \"Funeral\" was the runaway indie-rock \nsuccess story of 2005, selling 310,000 copies for Merge and \nattracting the support of Bono and David Bowie. The \nMontreal-based band spent significant chunks of 2006 working on \n\"Neon Bible\" and opted to self-produce the set. \"We kind of \nrealized that we already know how we want things to sound so we \nshould just run after that sound as fast as we can and not rely \non someone else to guide the good ship Arcade Fire,\" frontman \nWin Butler says. The pipe organ-laced \"Intervention\" was made available for \nsampling via a toll-free number on December 15, sending \nindie-rock blogs into a tizzy, and five London shows in late \nJanuary/early February sold out in two minutes.\n GUNS N' ROSES Chinese Democracy (Geffen, March 6) In late December, Axl Rose broke his silence to announce he \nhad parted ways with manager Merck Mercuriadis and that the \ndecade-in-the-making \"Chinese Democracy\" would finally arrive \nMarch 6. It's anybody's guess if the date will hold, but a \nmonster first week is a fair bet.\n AIR Pocket Symphony (Astralweks, March 6) Pulp's Jarvis Cocker and the Divine Comedy's Neil Hannon \nlend vocals to the French duo's latest, which is highlighted by \nthe sexy instrumental opener \"Space Maker\" and the \npulse-quickening electro-pop of \"Mer du Japon.\" Drown yourself \nin the bottle during the Cocker-sung \"Hell of a Party,\" a \nsomber reflection on the morning after.\n GOOD CHARLOTTE Good Morning Revival (Epic, March 20) \"It sounds like Good Charlotte,\" frontman Joel Madden says \nmatter-of-factly about the Don Gilmore-produced \"Good Morning \nRevival.\" \"It sounds older. We sound more comfortable.\" Indeed, \nthe first taste of new music was \"Keep Your Hands Off My Girl,\" \nwhich Madden wrote after deciding, \"I want to make a song I can \nhear in the club.\" The set also includes \"I Don't Want to Be Loved,\" a heavily \nproduced rocker in the vein of the Killers' \"Jenny Was a Friend \nof Mine,\" and first single \"The River,\" which features metal \nact Avenged Sevenfold.\n THE STOOGES The Weirdness (Virgin, March 20) So what does the first Stooges album since 1973 sound like? \nAccording to Iggy Pop, it sounds like, er, the Stooges. \"You \nput it on and right away you'd know, well, that's them. There \nthey go,\" he says of the project, which was recorded by Steve \nAlbini and finds bassist Mike Watt filling in for the late Dave \nAlexander.\n AVRIL LAVIGNE The Best Dam Thing (RCA, date TBA) This curiously spelled April release will be preceded by \nthe single \"Girlfriend\" in February and also features \ncontributions from Lavigne's husband, Sum 41's Derryck Whibley, \nas well as +44 drummer Travis Barker. \"It is really fast, fun, young, bratty, aggressive, \nconfident (and) cocky in a playful way . . . all the good \nstuff,\" Lavigne wrote on her MySpace page earlier this month, \nadding that she was inspired to make a more uptempo album after \nspending \"so much of my time playing live shows. I wanted to \nmake sure the songs were fun -- fun for the fans and myself. I \nwill only have, like, three slow songs on the record.\" \"The Best Dam Thing\" will be the follow-up to 2004's \"Under \nMy Skin,\" which debuted at No. 1 on The Billboard 200 and has \nsold 2.93 million copies.\n MANDY MOORE Wild Hope (Firm Music, date TBA) \"It means a lot to me to make something that's mine,\" \nstresses Moore, who has forgone music for acting during the \npast four years. \"It's a passion project,\" she says of \"Wild \nHope,\" her debut on the Firm's label. \"It won't matter if it \ndoesn't sell tons or have this high level of success.\" Moore's new set strips away the gloss from her earlier Sony \nMusic recordings and finds her collaborating with such acts as \nthe Weepies (on \"Extraordinary\" and the pop hit-in-waiting \"All \nGood Things\"), Lori McKenna (\"Most of Me\"), Rachael Yamagata \n(\"Ladies Choice\") and Chantal Kreviazuk (\"Gardenia\").\n THREE 6 MAFIA Title TBA (Sony, date TBA) In February, Three 6 Mafia became the first rap act to win \na best song Academy Award with \"It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp,\" \nbut what does it have cooking for its next album? \"So far, \nwe've got Chamillionaire, Lyfe Jennings, Paul Wall and Keke,\" \nDJ Paul says of contributors to the follow-up to 2005's \"Most \nKnown Unknown,\" which spawned the hits \"Stay Fly\" and \"Poppin' \nMy Collar.\" \"Mainly just friends -- people we actually hang out \nwith and go to bars with.\" Reuters/Billboard", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/music-bestbets-dc-idUSN0126591620070102", "sectors": [["Music"]], "title": "mellencamp , jones albums among early ' 07 releases"},
{"date": "23:40 01 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " NEW YORK (Billboard) - Sick of the music scene in New York \nor London? It may be time to savor the delights of five \nunlikely cities spawning exciting new sounds.\n BEIJING Population: 14 million Main Language: Mandarin Chinese Shanghai may have become China's business heart, but \nBeijing remains its political and cultural capital -- and home \nto a burgeoning modern music scene eager to reach audiences \noutside the People's Republic. In the past, domestically successful rock bands like Tang \nDynasty, Spring Autumn and AK-47 have emerged from Beijing, as \ndid the \"godfather\" of Chinese rock, Cui Jian. Now a new \ngeneration of alternative acts is appearing. \"Beijing has solidified its place as the locus of modern \nmusic on the mainland,\" says Shen Lihui, CEO of leading Beijing \nindependent label Modern Sky. The healthy live scene is also starting to attract \ninternational acts such as U.S.-based banjo star Bela Fleck and \nU.K. alt-rockers Maximo Park. \"At the moment it's uncharted territory,\" says Maximo Park \nmanager Colin Schaverien. \"But in five years it will be a \nnatural routing point stop-off on the way to, or back from, \nJapan.\" The current crop of home-grown Beijing talent includes \nModern Sky's goth-influenced \"post-rock\" act the Retros, who \nwill appear at the South by Southwest confab in Austin, while \nambient/electronic rock duo FM3 -- which has been picked up \ninternationally after it was championed by Brian Eno -- has \nscheduled 30 European dates for 2007.\n BERLIN Population: 3.5 million Main Language: German Berlin's central role in the international dance music \nscene has been well-known since the Berlin Wall came down in \n1989. But now the relocated likes of electro artist Peaches; \nher fellow Canadian, techno pioneer Richie Hawtin (a.k.a. \nPlastikman); and U.S. DJ/producers Jay Haze and Stewart Walker \nare rubbing up against a burgeoning rock and pop scene as well. Metal act Rammstein blazed the trail, selling 10 million \nalbums worldwide. Now, with support from a network of 16 local \nradio stations, a new generation of local acts is following in \nRammstein's footsteps. Berlin boy band Tokio Hotel is the \nlatest Pan-European pop sensation, with global sales of more \nthan 2.4 million albums. Alt-rock act Virginia Jetzt has sold 20,000 copies of its \ndebut album, while rock bands El*ke and Superleutnaant and pop \noutfit Naomi are all hot 2007 tips. \"If you live in Berlin,\" Universal Music Germany CEO Frank \nBriegmann says, \"you are at the very heart of modern music.\"\n BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND Population: 1 million Main Language: English In a U.K. music scene perennially dominated by London and \nManchester, England's \"second city\" has struggled, musically, \nin recent years. Yet Birmingham and the surrounding West Midlands region has \nproduced acts ranging from rock monsters Led Zeppelin and Black \nSabbath to Duran Duran. Now, the city -- long derided as an \nindustrial wasteland -- has undergone hefty redevelopment and \nits music scene seems similarly re-energized. Locals say the \nsuccess of the Birmingham-based Editors, whose 2005 debut album \n\"The Back Room\" is BPI-certified platinum (300,000 units), \nhelped shift labels' talent-scouting focus to the city's \nindependent/alt-rock sector. Birmingham alt-rock act the Twang just signed a label deal \nwith B-Unique, the Polydor imprint that's home to the Kaiser \nChiefs. Unsigned acts that could be next in line include the \nWeezer-influenced Murdoch and punky trio the Untitled Musical \nProject, plus the Enemy (from nearby Coventry) and Ripchord \n(from Wolverhampton).\n BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA Population: 2 million Main Language: English The eastern city of Brisbane has launched successful bands \nbefore -- from the Bee Gees in the '60s to Savage Garden in the \n'90s -- but now it has hit such a rich vein of talent that it's \nthreatening Melbourne's traditional role as Australia's main \nmusic city. The city has spawned both of Australia's current biggest \nhome-grown rock and pop groups: Powderfinger (1 million career \nsales) and the Veronicas (350,000 units), as well as solo \nsensation Pete Murray (600,000). Major label execs are now \nregulars in town, looking to do battle with local imprints. \"Brisbane's always a city I keep my eye on,\" says Michael \nParisi, Melbourne-based president of A&R (artists and \nrepertoire) at Warner Music, who helped put the city on the map \nwhen he signed art rock act Regurgitator in the mid-'90s. Parisi's new hip-hop signing Butterfingers heads the pack \nof new, young Brisbane bands looking to break out in 2007; it \nis followed by heavy-rock band the Butterfly Effect and \nsinger/songwriters Andrew Morris, Katie Miller-Heidke and Kate \nBradley. The live scene, based around the city's famous Fortitude \nValley nightclub district, is also booming.\n MARSEILLE, FRANCE Population: 1.2 million Main Language: French This bustling Mediterranean port is France's second city in \nterms of population, behind Paris -- and it's growing, at more \nthan 100,000 people per year. A large population of North African origin, along with the \nnative French and a substantial community from sub-Saharan \nAfrica, make this soccer-mad city an ethno-musical melting pot, \nwhere cheerleaders at Stade Velodrome -- home to leading team \nOlympique Marseille -- use decks and soundsystems. More and more, French promoters describe Marseille's \n10,000-capacity main venue Le Dome as \"a must\" for visiting \nurban talent -- Snoop Dogg and the Roots played there recently, \nwith Beyonce booked for 2007. Following established local rap and reggae acts like IAM \nand Massilia Sound System, politicized female rapper Keny \nArkana has sold 50,000 copies of her debut album \"Entre Ciment \net Belles Etoiles\" despite a refusal to do mainstream \npromotion. Other names to watch include quirky rock/hip-hop duo Oai \nStar, eclectic reggae/Cajun trio Moussu Te Lei Jovents and \nAliman Staff.

{"date": "19:42 31 December 2006 (UTC)", "text": " NEW YORK (Billboard) - In the troubled music industry, flat \nsales are the new up for retailers. According to Nielsen SoundScan, album sales totaled 105.3 \nmillion for the six-week period ended December 24. That's 4.1% \ndown from 2005's total of 109.8 million. And 2005 was \nconsidered the weakest holiday selling season in memory. Still, retailers choose to see a half-full glass. Billboard \nspoke with more than 20, responsible for roughly 40% of U.S. \nsales. \"We had a good week Christmas week, and (the day after \nChristmas) was great,\" says Rob Perkins, president of 67-unit, \nMarietta, Ga.-based Value Music. \"For the overall holiday \nselling season, we made plan, which means comparable-store \nsales were slightly down.\" Music label executives may cheer the volume of purchases: \nwhen digital track, music video and singles sales are included, \nsales totaled 47.4 million units for Christmas week, according \nto SoundScan. That tops the prior best-week sales total of 46.5 \nmillion units, recorded during the Christmas week of 2000, the \nyear that U.S. album sales peaked. However, digital sales are still not offsetting declines in \nthe physical space. Using SoundScan's album equivalency of 10 \ndigital tracks sold -- generous, considering a typical album \nhas more -- this year total album sales equaled 111.4 million \nunits for the holiday selling period, still a 2.1% decline from \nlast year's equivalent total of 113.8 million. Varying from merchant to merchant, 2006 holiday selling \nseason comparable-store sales ranged from slightly down to 10% \ndown. In Brighton, Mass., Mike Dreese -- CEO of 25-store chain \nNewbury Comics -- says the holiday selling season was \"OK. \nNovember was not good, but December was pretty good.\" On a comparable-store basis, the chain's sales were down \nabout 7% during December. In Nashville, Music City VP Scott Perkins reports that in \nthe nine days leading up to Christmas, the 25-unit chain was \ndown about 10% on a comparable-store basis. \"We have seen worse \npercentages down in (comparable-store) sales,\" he says. \"We \nwill take any positive spin we can get.\" Likewise, in Omaha, Neb., Mike Fratt, GM at the six-store \nHomer's chain, reports that comparable-store holiday sales were \ndown \"high single digits.\" Fratt says, \"We couldn't tell if there were any hits, \nbecause we lost that business to the big boxes (like Target and \nBest Buy) who were all selling the top hits at $9.99 . . . \nBusiness kicked in for us about 10 days out, I guess because \nthe mass merchants ran out and were unable to reload in time.\" Joe Nardone Jr., VP at the 11-unit Gallery of Sound chain \nin Wilkes-Barre, Pa., says he saw a few hits emerge, including \nnew releases from Nas, Eminem and the Beatles. Hinder's \n\"Extreme Behavior,\" Daughtry's self-titled album and Twisted \nSister's \"Twisted Christmas\" did better than expected, he says. \nAnd right at the end of the season, according to Nardone, \nJustin Timberlake's \"FutureSex/LoveSounds\" exploded while My \nChemical Romance's \"The Black Parade\" and Akon's \"Konvicted\" \nalso picked up.\n SURPRISE SELLERS At Newbury, Dreese reported that the chain underestimated \nthe fire power of Sarah McLachlan's \"Wintersong,\" James \nTaylor's \"At Christmas\" and Tony Bennett's \"Duets: An American \nClassic.\" Other titles that did well include Young Jeezy's \"The \nInspiration,\" Beyonce's \"B'Day,\" Ciara's \"The Evolution\" and \nthe J.J. Cale & Eric Clapton album \"The Road to Escondido,\" \nValue Music's Perkins reports. One surprise this year was the superb performance of \nChristmas music. In fact, one major-label executive says, \"If \nit weren't for holiday music, everybody would be in the \ntoilet.\" Retail executives regularly cited Christmas albums by \nTaylor, McLachlan and Il Divo as showing up in their top 10 \nbest-selling albums of the season. At Starbucks in Seattle, the chain's own exclusive \"Santa \nBaby\" compilation drove music sales, Starbucks Entertainment \npresident Ken Lombard says. Issued in November, it has since \ncrossed the 250,000-unit mark, he reported just before \nChristmas. While most brick-and-mortar merchants reported sales \ndeclines, online merchants selling physical goods had a banner \nyear, according to one wholesaler who does fulfillment for such \nretailers. Indeed, Amazon claimed it had its best holiday \nselling season ever, though it declined to release specific \nnumbers. SoundScan reports that nontraditional merchants--which \ninclude catalog merchants and albums sold at concerts or \nthrough TV direct-marketing campaigns -- enjoyed a 35.5% \nincrease during the holiday.

{"date": "19:42 31 December 2006 (UTC)", "text": " NEW YORK (Billboard) - You can't blame U2's concert \npromoter for wondering just how big the band's Vertigo world \ntour could have been if it had simply kept on playing. After all, not one ticket went unsold for the 131 shows on \nthe trek, which began March 28, 2005, in San Diego and wrapped \nDecember 9 in front of 47,000 fans at Honolulu's Aloha Stadium. Having been on the road in fits and starts since March \n2005, U2 was clearly in a celebratory mood in Hawaii, as Bono \ndanced onstage with a woman from the crowd during \"Mysterious \nWays\" and even pulled a lucky guy out of the audience to play \npiano with the band during \"Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses.\" \nWhether waving the American flag high above his head amid \nopener \"City of Blinding Lights\" or writhing on the stage \nblindfolded for \"Bullet the Blue Sky,\" the frontman was holding \nnothing back. When all was said and done, Vertigo clocked in as the \nsecond-highest grossing tour of all time: $389 million from an \nastonishing audience of 4,619,021, second only to the Rolling \nStones' concurrent A Bigger Bang trek, which may continue into \n2007, and has grossed more. \"I sometimes try and visualize, what would be the \nuniverse?\" promoter Arthur Fogel told Billboard. \"In other \nwords, what if you could just play and play and play? We sold \nover four-and-a-half million tickets on this tour, but we still \nunderplayed basically everywhere we've gone.\" Vertigo visited arenas in North America through late May \n2005, then played stadiums in Europe throughout that summer. In \nthe fall, it was back to North America for a run that included \nsix shows at Toronto's Air Canada Center and six at New York's \nMadison Square Garden. February and March took U2 to South America, which was \noriginally to be followed by dates in Australia, New Zealand \nand Japan. Those shows, however, were postponed until the fall \ndue to a serious illness that struck within the immediate \nfamily of a band member. Details have never been publicly \ndisclosed. Getting Vertigo back on track was the final hurdle for \nFogel. He and U2 manager Paul McGuinness say they're in contact \nall the time, even a year before the first fan has filed into a \nvenue. \"As the record develops, the production develops,\" \nMcGuinness said. \"And depending on when the record is finished, \nwe have an imaginary start date. That's subject to change, but \nthe thinking about the production is always simultaneous with \nthe making of the album.\" The Vertigo stage set featured an ellipse-shaped extension \nthat allowed band members to travel far into the \ngeneral-admission crowd on the floor. It required 30 semi \ntrucks to get from place to place, according to stage manager \nRocko Reedy. On a good day, it took two-and-a-half hours to \nassemble, but that duration could nearly double depending on \nweather and venue configurations. After being loaded post-show \nonto the trucks, the stage was packed onto three 747s to travel \nto the next venue. Early in the tour, U2 performed in front of seven \nsee-through LED curtains, onto which images and patterns were \nprojected. Later, a giant, super high-tech LED screen was used \ninstead to form the backdrop. \"All the stuff we use is always serial number 001,\" Reedy \nsaid. \"The first time they create this type of technology, it's \nU2 that uses it. Then everybody else under the sun goes out and \ngets it, so we just have to come up with something new.\" That said, Vertigo has not been without its share of drama. \nThe tour got off to a rocky start after a disastrous presale \nfor paid members of u2.com in January 2005, when demand far \nexceeded the ticket allotment, prompting shut-out fans to blast \nmanagement and even band members themselves on Internet forums. \"The demand was artificially stimulated because, quite \nhonestly, a lot of ticket scalpers had joined u2.com planning \nto trade the tickets,\" McGuinness said. \"It was clear very \nearly those tickets would have a higher resale value than face \nvalue. We got caught by that, and we certainly underestimated \nthe demand that would arise through the fan club. We did the \nbest we could to meet it. But we'll be a little more careful \nnext time.\" Then, in the wake of the Asia-Pacific postponements, Fogel \nspent months dealing with insurance issues. \"That process took \na very long time and was very difficult in complex, but \nultimately resulted favorably,\" he says. \"That probably was a \nmuch greater challenge than the actual logistics of bringing \nthe production and personnel back together. \"We had a few venue issues (rescheduling) in Japan, because \noriginally we were playing outdoors at Yokohama Stadium,\" he \nadded. \"Given we were now in early December, the weather is \nsuch that we had to then look to go indoors. So, we had to \nbasically refund 60,000 tickets and then resell for three shows \nat an arena.\" But, to the surprise of nobody, the fans were still right \nthere waiting to attend the makeup dates. \"In Australia, even \nthough we were postponing the shows by six months or so, almost \nno customers asked for a refund,\" McGuinness said. And indeed, \nthe time off allowed U2 to rejigger the tour set list, as well \nas record \"The Saints Are Coming\" and the new song \"Window in \nthe Skies\" with producer Rick Rubin. Both were released on the \ncompilation \"U218 Singles\" in November. While it may have been tempting to entertain adding still \nmore shows to the itinerary after the fall leg, McGuinness said \nthis was \"a logical point to stop. We're obviously aware we \ncould go on and on and on, but selling out (venues) is actually \nmore important to us than the gross.\" So where does the U2 go from here? The first destination is \nthe recording studio, sometime in 2007, with an eye on \nreleasing a new album by the end of the year. McGuinness \npredicted the next tour would then begin in 2008. \"All I can say is it will be completely different the next \ntime, but it will be big,\" he said. \"I think our audience \nexpects very big productions. We've become good at doing that, \nand I think it is part of U2's reputation.\" The band may even \nexperiment with commercially releasing select concerts as \ndownloads shortly after their completion. \"That's something \nwe're exploring,\" McGuinness acknowledged. \"In the future there \nwill be more what we call 'band-to-fan activity.\"' Reuters/Billboard", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/music-u2-dc-idUSN2925649020070102", "sectors": [["Music"]], "title": "u2 : from joshua trees to palm trees"},

One of the most strived-for dynamics in the touring \nbusiness is when a veteran band not only maintains its \npopularity, but then develops a surge in popularity built by \nword-of-mouth and consistently strong performances. That is the \ncase with Tool, which released its first album in 1992. The \nband's 2006 tour behind its \"10,000 Days\" release was its most \nsuccessful yet.

That kept the yen under pressure by preserving the carry trade in which investors borrow cheap yen to buy higher-yielding assets.The median forecast of 16 banks polled by Reuters in December 2005 put the dollar at 108 yen by the end of 2006.Instead, the yen ended the year at 119 per dollar, little changed from late 2005. It was near an all-time high above 157 per euro, 12 percent weaker than when 2006 began.With the Bank of Japan seen raising rates more aggressively in 2007 and the European Central Bank likely to extend its tightening campaign in the first half of the year, analysts expect carry trades to unwind in 2007 and the yen to rise.But strategists at Goldman Sachs, who got 58 percent of their short-term trade recommendations right to net a total return of 12.2 percent, warned in a research note that \"getting the timing right on such an unwinding is tricky.\"For one thing, those who were burned in 2006 may not be as eager to jump on the yen bandwagon this time around, especially given that the Bank of Japan has taken its time raising rates.Indeed, while markets are gearing up for a possible rate hike in late January, speculators continue to bet against the currency, keeping it under steady pressure.\"The market has sounded the death knell of the yen carry trade many times, but people continue to be short the yen,\" said Marc Chandler, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.Deutsche Bank strategists, who reported returns in excess of 3.4 percent on a package of G10 trade recommendations in 2006, forecast \"back-loaded\" yen strength in 2007, with a move to 98 yen per dollar by year-end.Strategists at BNP Paribas were more aggressive. In a year-end note to clients, they said a sharper-than-expected U.S. slowdown will push the euro to $1.40 and the dollar to 105 yen by midyear.The euro was another troublemaker for investors as it spent much of the year trapped in a $1.25-$1.29 range. It failed to get much mileage out of a steady stream of rate hikes from the European Central Bank and a pause in the Federal Reserve's own tightening campaign in August.Only in late November did the euro break above $1.30, helped by expectations that the Fed may have to cut rates next year to give a jolt to a faltering U.S. economy.THE BOY SCOUT APPROACH: 'BE PREPARED'There are those, though, that highlight a number of risks that could make currency trading as difficult in 2007 as it was in 2006.In what they called an \"alternative 2007\" forecast, strategists at State Street Global Markets in Boston highlight a number of risks that could upset the emerging consensus view of a stronger yen and euro, a weaker dollar and tighter global liquidity.Among them are a stabilization of the U.S. housing market, Federal Reserve interest rate hikes rather than cuts, dollar strength rather than weakness, and a sudden slowdown in the euro zone economy.\"As all good Boy Scouts know, 'be prepared' is not a bad rule to live by,\" they wrote in a note to clients.Recent U.S. economic data has been surprisingly robust, particularly reports on home sales that suggest the worst of the housing slump may have already passed.Chandler said a U.S. economic rebound is likely to surprise the market in 2007. \"The one bet that has proven wrong time and again is a bet against the U.S. consumer,\" he said.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-usa-forex-idUSN0233761820070102", "sectors": [], "title": "fx market ready for higher ' 07 returns"},

He denied making any deal with Nixon.* He escaped two assassination attempts in a 17-day span in 1975, and served on the Warren Commission which investigated the 1963 assassination of President John Kennedy.* At the Helsinki summit of 1975, Ford and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev signed agreements in effect swapping Western acknowledgment of post-war Soviet domination in central Europe for Moscow's vows to liberalize human rights and ease border restrictions.* Ford declared the Vietnam War \"finished as far as America is concerned\" on April 23, 1975, and the U.S.-backed Saigon government fell one week later. Congress had rejected Ford's last-ditch efforts to boost military aid to Saigon.* Ford represented Michigan in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1949 and rose through Republican ranks to become House minority leader in the 1960s.

He lost to Democrat Jimmy Carter in his 1976 bid for a full term, in one of the closest U.S. elections in U.S. history.* Ford played on the University of Michigan's national championship football teams in 1932 and 1933 and turned down offers to play with the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers in the National Football League.

I think ETA has been defeated, and we are at its funeral,\" Conde-Pumpido told newspaper El Mundo.\"That doesn't mean we can't have tragedies or setbacks, like the Barajas bomb,\" he said,ETA's political ally Batasuna, a party banned for its links to the guerrillas, insists it still wanted to negotiate peace.But Basque separatists have been frustrated that the ceasefire did not lead to an easing of police pressure on ETA or the transfer of guerrilla prisoners to jails nearer their homes. They were also angered at the continuing ban on Batasuna.\"Ultimately they would prefer the peaceful road, not to be letting off car bombs, but they feel that in the circumstances they have been betrayed,\" said Alec Reid, an Irish priest who has been involved with peace efforts in both the Basque Country and Northern Ireland.\"I am certain that the peace process will go ahead at the end of the day, with the Lord's help,\" he told Reuters by telephone, adding that Saturday's bomb reminded him of when the IRA broke a ceasefire in 1996 before returning to talks.(Additional reporting by Ben Harding)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-spain-eta-idUSL024808020070102", "sectors": [["World"]], "title": "spain says peace process broken by eta bomb"},

He was re-elected five times, serving 28 years, before losing in 1993 to Ehud Olmert, now Israel's prime minister.\"Kollek's name and the glory of Jerusalem will forever remain inseparable,\" Olmert said in a statement mourning his former political foe, who will be buried on Thursday in a section reserved for Israel's leaders in the city's Mount Herzl cemetery.Kollek, born in Nagyvazsony in what is now Hungary, and raised in Vienna, launched more ambitious building and restoration projects in Jerusalem than any city father since 16th century Turkish Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, who built the Old City walls.Instantly recognizable in his suit and open-necked shirt, Kollek would set out on morning \"inspection\" walks through Jerusalem's diverse neighborhoods. He publicly listed his home telephone number, saying the mayor should be available to all.\"We proved that Jerusalem is a better city united than divided,\" Kollek once said in an interview.Israel annexed East Jerusalem shortly after the 1967 war in a move not recognized internationally.

{"date": "14:18 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " (Updates prices, adds strategist comment)NEW YORK Jan 2 (Reuters) - U.S. government bond prices\nrose slightly on Tuesday in a modest recovery from last week,\nwhen the market sold off on stronger-than-expected economic\nreports. Volume was light during a session shortened for a day of\nmourning to honor former U.S. President Gerald Ford. Many\ntrading desks were thinly staffed as financial markets were\neither closed or open only for a half-session on Tuesday, when\nthe United States held a state funeral service for the former\npresident. That left Tuesday virtually devoid of economic data for\nbond investors. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM)\nmanufacturing report on Wednesday and the monthly nonfarm\npayrolls report, due on Friday could be major catalysts for the\nTreasury market. \"This is that sort of bounce that you get after the\npounding the bond market took last week,\" said Kevin Flanagan,\nfixed income strategist for global wealth management with\nMorgan Stanley in Purchase, New York. \"I wouldn't read too much\ninto it and we are still at a kind of half staffed situation,\"\nFlanagan said. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR were up 3/32 in price\nfor a yield of 4.69 percent from 4.70 percent late on Friday.\nMarkets were closed on Monday for the New Year's Day public\nholiday. \"We don't really want to make much of the firmer action as\nno key levels were taken out and there was little sense of\nmomentum developing or strong buying,\" said David Ader, head of\ngovernment bond strategy with RBS Greenwich Capital in\nGreenwich, Connecticut. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association\nrecommended an early bond market close at 2 p.m. (1900 GMT) on\nTuesday. \"For the week, the big number will be the employment report\non Friday,\" said Don Kowalchik, a debt strategist at A.G.\nEdwards & Sons in St. Louis. If the jobs data surprises, the\n10-year Treasury note's yield could test the upper or lower\nlimits of its near term range, around 4.75 percent and 4.50\npercent, Kowalchik said. The 10-year note's yield, which moves inversely to its\nprice, jumped to 4.70 percent at the end of December from 4.46\npercent at the start of that month. Last week, stronger-than-expected U.S. economic reports on\nhome sales, consumer confidence and Chicago manufacturing\nweighed on bond prices as prospects of a Federal Reserve\ninterest rate cut early this year appeared to dwindle. Perceived prospects for the Fed to lower rates by June, as\nshown by short-term U.S. interest rate futures, had fallen to\nabout 58 percent late on Friday after being fully priced as\nrecently as Dec. 21. Further insight into the Federal Reserve's thinking may\ncome from the release on Wednesday of the minutes from its last\nmonetary policy meeting on Dec 12. Two-year notes US2YT=RR_on_Tuesday were trading 1/32\nhigher in price for a yield of 4.80 percent from 4.82 percent\nlate on Friday, while five-year notes were 1/32 higher in price\nfor a yield of 4.68 percent from 4.69 percent.

(LEN.N) and a Cerberus Capital Management holding said on Tuesday they will sell a 62 percent stake in a joint venture that owns 15,000 acres in southern California for more than $1.3 billion.Lennar also slashed its forecast for a fourth-quarter profit before one-time items by as much as 46 percent, citing lower profit margins amid the deteriorating U.S. housing market.It will record a net loss due to pretax charges of up to $500 million to write off deposits and pre-acquisition costs for land under option it doesn't intend to buy.Home builders have cut forecasts and posted lower earnings over the last several quarters as demand has slumped, and Lennar Chief Executive Stuart Miller sees no end in sight.\"Market conditions continued to weaken throughout the fourth quarter and we have not yet seen tangible evidence of a market recovery,\" he said in a statement.Under the deal with MW Housing Partners, Lennar and Cerberus's LNR Property Corp. each will receive a cash distribution of about $660 million from the newly restructured LandSource Communities Development LLC, which owns 15,000 acres of land in Santa Clarita Valley, about 30 miles north of downtown Los Angeles, Lennar said.MW Housing will contribute cash and property to the venture with a combined value of about $900 million in exchange for the 62 percent financial interest in LandSource, Lennar said.MW Housing is co-managed by real estate investment management company MacFarlane Partners and includes the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS).As of July 1, LandSource had assets with a book value of about $1.3 billion, with its primary investment being the Newhall Land and Farming Co., which owns the Santa Clarita land that includes 23,000 residential home sites and 700 acres of commercial land and other property.The MW Housing property, on which Lennar has options, is being contributed based on fair market value, Lennar said. The home builder will continue to have options to purchase those home sites at market prices.While MW Housing will hold the 62 percent financial interest, it will have 50 percent voting control of the venture, which will continue to be jointly operated by Lennar and LNR, Lennar said.The deal is expected to close in February, Lennar said.Lennar will see about $500 million in profit from the transaction, of which about $125 million will be recognized at closing and about $375 million will be deferred over future years.It also will receive management fees over the next 11 years and retain an interest in LandSource of about 19 percent.Under terms of the deal, LandSource assets are valued at about $2.6 billion, with a potential increase adjustment to that value of over $600 million, Lennar said.For the fourth quarter, Lennar cut its profit outlook because of \"materially lower gross margins on home sales ... as a result of deteriorating market conditions in the home building industry.\"Excluding charges of between $400 million and $500 million related to the land-related write-offs, the Miami-based company now expects fourth-quarter earnings in the range of 70 to 75 cents a share.In September, Lennar had cut its forecast to a range of $1 to $1.30 a share from a range of $2.55 to $2.60 a share. Analysts already had cut their consensus estimate to $1.07 a share, according to Reuters Estimates.After the charges, Lennar expects a loss in the range of 88 cents to $1.28 a share.Lennar said deliveries fell 2.8 percent to 14,403 homes in the quarter, while new orders declined 6 percent and backlog slumped 42 percent from a year ago to $4 billion at the end of November.(Additional reporting by Lilla Zuill and Chris Kaufman in New York)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-caneylennar-lnr-idUSN0231889320070102", "sectors": [["M&A, ", "Markets"]], "title": "lennar to cut stake in venture , slashes outlook"},

The hanging fueled charges by minority Sunni Muslims that the execution, of a fellow Sunni was an act of retribution by majority Shi'ites.Maliki, a Shi'ite, was sworn in May as the head of a coalition of Shi'ites, Sunnis and Kurds, with hopes of averting a sectarian war three years after Saddam's ouster in a U.S.-led invasion.

They urged more oil explorations.\"The outlook for the year is pretty gloomy,\" Lazaro Cuesta, a babalawo who organizes the annual predictions, said at a news conference. \"We are appealing for common sense to prevail.\"Many Cubans hope the younger Castro, 75, will introduce economic reforms to deal with day-to-day hardships they have faced since Cuba lost billions of dollars in subsidies when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.Raul Castro, a low-key defense minister who has long lived in the shadow of his brother, has set about dealing with the main problems Cuban complain about: high food prices, poor public transport and dilapidated housing.\"Change is coming whether this government is there or not.

{"date": "15:36 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " (Adds NPD sales figures) By Nicole MaestriNEW YORK Jan 2 (Reuters) - Investors will get a final\ntally on holiday sales this week as retailers release December\nsales figures amid concerns heavy promotions used to lure\ncustomers will cut into profits. Most U.S. retailers report December sales on Thursday,\nwhile electronics retailers Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY.N) and\nCircuit City Stores Inc. CC.N weigh in with their sales on\nFriday. Industry leader Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT.N) has already\nsaid its sales rose 1.6 percent in December at U.S. stores open\nat least a year, according to preliminary data, beating its own\nforecast of flat to up 1 percent. \"We believe Wal-Mart managed to deliver its above plan 1.6\npercent comp (comparable-store sales) because of an extra\nselling day, an easy after Christmas week comparison, and\naggressive promotions as the season winded down,\" wrote Goldman\nSachs analyst Adrianne Shapira in a note. But she said the \"above plan\" sales for the retailer, which\naggressively promoted lower prices on electronics and toys,\nwere likely driven by \"above plan\" markdowns, which does not\nbode well for fourth-quarter earnings. The impact of markdowns will also be closely monitored in\nthe sales reports this week. \"Everyone is going to be looking to see if there's any\nmention within that news release of any change in earnings\nguidance, or anything in the language of the description of\nwhat occurred that can point toward and suggest earnings\ndirection for Q4,\" said Bernard Sands retail analyst Richard\nHastings. \"Q4 earnings is a big question mark and it looks like it's\nnot going to be a very good quarter for a lot of retailers.\" BATTLING ELECTRONICS Retail Metrics LLC, with an index of 57 retailers, expects\nDecember same-store sales to rise 3.3 percent, compared with a\n3.4 percent increase a year ago. Excluding Wal-Mart, the index forecasts a 4.6 percent gain\nin December same-store sales, and a 3.5 percent gain excluding\nWal-Mart and drug store chains. The index does not include Best\nBuy or Circuit City. Electronics were brisk sellers this holiday season as\nprices for flat-panel televisions plunged and retailers heavily\npromoted TVs, digital cameras, laptop computers and MP3 players\nto draw shoppers into their stores. Consumer technology retail sales from the week of Black\nFriday -- the day after Thanksgiving -- through the week ended\nDec. 23 were $8.75 billion -- up 6.5 percent from a year ago,\naccording to NPD Group. But this year's gain trailed last\nyear's 10 percent revenue rise due in part to the falling\nprices for flat-panel TVs, the market research firm said. While promotions -- which featured 42-inch plasma TVs\nselling for under $1,000 during the Thanksgiving shopping\nweekend -- drove sales, Best Buy and Circuit City have already\nsaid it hurt their profits for the third-quarter, which ended\nin November. The demand for the expensive advanced TVs could also mean\ndifficult results for apparel retailers if shoppers decided\nagainst buying that extra sweater or scarf after shelling out\nhundreds or thousands of dollars for a TV. Wall Street is also watching to see how retailers dealt\nwith procrastinators. Shoppers visited stores in droves during the November\nThanksgiving shopping weekend, but then paused and waited for\nretailers to roll out last-minute deals in December before they\nfinished their holiday shopping. \"We definitely know that the first half of the month was\nslow,\" said Dana Telsey, founder of research firm Telsey\nAdvisory Group. She said the question is: \"What was the pick-up in the\nsecond half of the month and how much did the last week add?\" Christmas fell on a Monday this year, giving shoppers a\nfinal weekend to shop ahead of the holiday. Retailers also faced unfavorable weather conditions in\nDecember. Shapira said the Goldman Sachs Rain or Shine\nIndicator showed the weather was 21 percent warmer this\nDecember compared with a year ago. \"Getting into the holiday spirit was tough when there was\nno hint of winter in the air. Those retailers waiting for\nweather to break had a nail biter of a month,\" she wrote.\n\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/retail-sales-outlook-idUSN0216685920070102", "sectors": [["Markets"]], "title": "update 1 - divining fourth - quarter earnings from us december sales"},

{"date": "07:47 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " LOS ANGELES (Billboard) - The anti-digital rights \nmanagement (DRM) bandwagon is getting more crowded by the day. \nEven some major-label executives are pushing for the right to \nsell digital downloads as unprotected MP3s. In 2007, the majors will get the message, and the DRM wall \nwill begin to crumble. Why? Because they'll no longer be able \nto point to a growing digital marketplace as justification that \nDRM works. Revenue from digital downloads and mobile content is \nexpected to be flat or, in some cases, decline next year. If \nthe digital market does in fact stall, alternatives to DRM will \nlook much more attractive. Revenue from digital music has yet to offset losses from \nstill-declining CD sales, and digital track sales remain a \ncause for concern. Month-over-month download figures were \nlargely flat through 2006, even in the face of year-over-year \ngains. If the expected post-holiday spike in download numbers \nthat has occurred in the past two years is weak, look for the \nglass on the panic button to break. \"People in the industry will have a very different \nconversation in January when the dust clears and they realize \njust how bad this year really was,\" says Eric Garland, CEO of \npeer-to-peer (P2P) tracking firm BigChampagne. Even more of a concern is mobile. According to Gartner G2 \nanalyst Mike McGuire, the ringtone market -- currently \ncontributing more than half of all digital revenue -- will \nsoften during the next 12-18 months as it matures. Meanwhile, the music industry wants a strong competitor to \nthe monster it created called iTunes. Forcing would-be \ncompetitors to sell music incompatible with the popular iPod is \nnot showing any signs of working. Removing DRM would attract \npowerful new players to the market, and that -- the theory goes \n-- will result in more buyers. \"The majors . . . have got to capitulate, or they will \ncontinue to have a fractured digital media market that will \nslow down and stagnate,\" says Terry McBride, president of \nNettwerk Music Group, management home of such acts as Sarah \nMcLachlan and Avril Lavigne. Here are five places to watch this year's DRM developments:\n AMAZON The online retailer reportedly is itching to get into \ndigital downloads but is holding out for a DRM-free service. It \nsells as many iPods as anybody and is a haven for music that is \ndisappearing from physical retail shelves. \"They already have a \nrelationship with our consumer the way that a lot of others \ndon't,\" Blue Note GM Zach Hochkeppel says. Viewed as the \nbiggest threat to iTunes, Amazon has the power to force a DRM \nstrategy shift.\n LIMEWIRE Still in the process of settling with the music industry, \nthe P2P file-sharing service wants to start charging its 40 \nmillion users $1 per download and share the revenue and \nuser-behavior information with the music industry. But it wants \nto stay DRM-free. The company hired TAG Strategic consultant \nTed Cohen, a former EMI exec, to convince the majors to at \nleast test the idea for six months.\n MYSPACE The most popular Internet destination in the world is \nworking with SnoCap to launch a music download service that \nwould let musicians sell music directly from their profiles and \nthat of their fans. But it will only sell files as MP3s. It is \nmoving ahead by focusing on independent and unsigned artists \nwilling to release unprotected music, and a successful showing \nwould make the majors take notice.\n EMUSIC The indie-only specialist just surpassed 100 million \ndownloads; it's the second-largest digital music retailer after \niTunes, all sans DRM. CEO David Packman says he is not \ninterested in selling major-label fare, but he may have no \nchoice if majors suddenly allow his competitors to sell in MP3 \nas well. But even if the majors did relent to MP3 sales on \neMusic, the company's business model would have to change--no \nlabel will agree to 50 downloads for $15 per month.\n YAHOO MUSIC GM David Goldberg has convinced Sony BMG and EMI Music \nGroup to test the DRM-free waters with limited, promotional \n\"experiments\" involving Jessica Simpson, Jesse McCartney, \nRelient K and Norah Jones. The lessons learned from these tests \nwill either speed or slow their path to eliminating DRM.

GM, which has dominated the sport utility vehicle and truck\nmarket for years but has steadily lost share to Asian\ncompetitors in the car category, plans to launch its redesigned\n2008 Malibu in early 2008. Industry analysts have said GM needs a strong entry in the\nmid-size sedan market, where its largest brand, Chevrolet, has\nlagged for years. GM, which lost $10.6 billion in 2005, is in\nthe middle of a broad turnaround that involves cutting jobs,\nclosing plants, reducing structural costs and increasing its\nfocus on cars and crossover vehicles. The Malibu, which will be unveiled at the North American\nInternational Auto Show in Detroit later this month, will\ncompete with Toyota Motor Corp.'s (7203.T) Camry and Honda\nMotor Co. Ltd. (7267.T) Accord. GM sold 100,000 to 125,000 current-model Malibus in the\npast year, less than a third of the Camry's total annual\nsales. The Malibu sold for an average of $17,939 in December,\nafter an average cash rebate of $2,438, according to data\ncollected from dealers by the Power Information Network.

GM said the redesigned car will compete with the Camry on\nfuel economy and price. The Camry starts at $18,720. The new Malibu will be quieter inside and have new standard\nsafety equipment such as side curtain airbags and stability\ncontrol, GM said.

The dollar's losses were most pronounced against European\ncurrencies such as the euro, sterling and the Swedish crown,\nwhere central banks are seen as likely to keep raising interest\nrates in 2007, narrowing the gap with U.S. interest rates. Liquidity was significantly thinned on Tuesday by a market\nholiday in Japan and closure of the U.S. stock market to\ncommemorate the death of former President Gerald Ford. Currency\ntrading also wound down early in the United States, analysts\nsaid. \"At this juncture of the new year, it's a yield story,\"\nsaid Ron Simpson, director of currency research at Action\nEconomics in Tampa, Florida. But \"there was very little\nindication overnight of significant flows and people are just\njockeying for position.\" The euro EUR= was up 0.6 percent at $1.3274 late\nafternoon in New York, adding to an 11.5 percent gain against\nthe dollar in 2006, its best performance in three years. The euro also rose to yet another record peak against the\nJapanese yen EURJPY=, rising as high as 157.90 yen, according\nto EBS, an electronic trading platform. It also rose to a near\nseven-year high of 1.6121 Swiss francs EURCHF=, according to\nReuters data. \"The Swiss franc and the yen are still fairly weak versus\nthe euro, indicating that risk appetite in the market is high\nand carry trades are very much in vogue,\" said Michael\nKlawitter, currency strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort in\nFrankfurt. Indicating the continued popularity of carry trades, in\nwhich investors sell low-yielding currencies for high yielders,\nthe Australian dollar hit nine-year highs above 94.50 yen\nAUDJPY=R. The dollar was down 0.2 percent at 118.85 yen JPY=. Japan's Yomiuri newspaper reported on Tuesday that the Bank\nof Japan would consider raising rates at its policy meeting on\nJan. 17-18, but added a hike might be delayed depending on\n\"adjustments\" between the BOJ and the nation's ruling parties. Meanwhile, financial markets are pricing in at least one\nrate cut for the United States in 2007, although surprising\nstrength in some recent data has pushed out the expected timing\nof such a move. \"Another few rounds of decent data and Treasury yields will\nprice out a rate cut and that will be good for the dollar,\"\nsaid Action's Simpson. The minutes of the Federal Reserve's December policy\nmeeting may help shed some light on the outlook for rates.

The institute said combined mining, oil and natural gas\nproduction, normally the main driver in the South American\ncountry's fast-growing economy, fell 7.06 percent in November\nfrom the same month of 2005. The metals mining sector alone fell 8.85 percent from a\nyear ago, with gold production down a steep 28.15 percent,\nmainly due to a fall in the grade of ore extracted at the\nYanacocha mine -- Latin America's biggest. Peru is the world's\nfifth-biggest gold producer. Yanacocha is majority-owned by U.S. company Newmont Mining\nCorp (NEM.N). Tin output fell 13.36 percent, INEI said.

Nevertheless, Peru produced 13.88 percent more copper, 4.89\npercent more zinc and 6.14 percent more silver than in November\n2005, the institute said.

Domestic bond prices rose modestly, rebounding somewhat\nfrom last week's sharp fall. The currency finished at C$1.1636 to the U.S. dollar, or\n85.94 U.S. cents, up from C$1.1654 to the U.S. dollar, or 85.81\nU.S. cents, at Friday's close. Canadian markets were closed on\nMonday for the New Year holiday. Fears of a steep U.S. slowdown have pressured both the\nCanadian and U.S. dollars, as any U.S. woes would translate\ninto weaker demand for Canadian exports and for commodities,\nwhose prices generally support the Canadian currency. \"It seems that the U.S.-negative sentiment that prevailed\nsince late November is carrying through to the beginning of\n2007,\" said Matthew Strauss, senior currency strategist at RBC\nCapital Markets. The Canadian dollar stayed just above nine-month lows hit\nlast week against the greenback, but volumes were thin as U.S.\nmarkets were closed and bond market trading shortened for a day\nof mourning to honor former U.S. President Gerald Ford. \"We're not seeing normal liquidity yet,\" said Strauss. Versus overseas currencies, the Canadian dollar's move was\nmore pronounced, as yield-seeking investors continued to warm\nto the prospects of higher interest rates in Europe. The currency touched a 19-month low against the euro and\npound, and a two-week low against the Swiss franc. Bank of Canada interest rates are expected to be cut later\nthis year, although analysts are split on the timing and will\ncontinue to focus on major pieces of economic data, such as\nFriday's release of December jobs data. The central bank next sets policy on Jan. 16, but is\nexpected to leave its overnight rate unchanged at 4.25 percent\nat that time. BONDS RISE Domestic bonds prices rose alongside U.S. treasuries,\nrebounding slightly from the market's steep losses last week. Liquidity was thin with the U.S. bond market closing early\nand with many traders still not back from holidays. Along with jobs data, the market will welcome November\nproducer and raw materials prices, as well as the December Ivey\nPurchasing Managers index this week. The the two-year bond climbed 5 Canadian cents to C$100.46\nto yield 3.999 percent, while the 10-year bond rose 16 Canadian\ncents to C$99.51 to yield 4.063 percent. The yield spread between the two-year and 10-year bond\nmoved to 6.4 basis points from 5.7 at the previous close. The 30-year bond rose 43 Canadian cents to C$126.15 to\nyield 4.116 percent.

Inc.\nSTA.N will stop paying contingent commissions to insurance\nagents and brokers by the start of 2008, according to a\nstatement by Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal on\nTuesday. Blumenthal said that St. Paul, one of the largest property\ncasualty insurers, had said in a letter to his office that it\nwould comply with a settlement reached last year with\nConnecticut, Illinois and New York to ban the practice for\ncertain coverages. A spokeswoman for St. Paul could not be reached for comment\nimmediately. Contingent commissions are monies given by insurers to\nagents who steer large amounts of business to those insurers.\nBut they also represent a conflict of interest, regulators say,\nbecause brokers are supposed to be working for the client\ncompany, not the insurer. Blumenthal said St. Paul told him in its letter that it\nwould provide a fixed-commission option for all agents on all\nlines of business and encourage brokers to accept that in lieu\nof contingent commissions in 2007. St. Paul will have all of\nits agents on a fixed-commission schedule by 2008, the attorney\ngeneral said. \"St. Paul Travelers is doing the right thing, voluntarily\nagreeing to stop paying contingent commissions,\" said\nBlumenthal. \"Insurance carriers do not need to pay contingent\ncompensation to profitably compete in the insurance industry.\" Blumenthal said he expected contingent commission bans to\nbe \"contagious\" in the industry, eventually ending a\n\"pay-to-play culture.\" Major insurance brokers including Marsh & McLennan Cos.\nInc. (MMC.N), Aon Corp. AOC.N and Willis Group Holdings Ltd.\n(WSH.N) have eliminated contingent commissions, but smaller\ninsurance brokers continue to take them. Regulators such as former New York Attorney General Eliot\nSpitzer have gone after insurers, trying to get them to stop\npaying these commissions to brokers. Last week Chubb Corp. (CB.N), another major property\ncasualty insurer, paid $17 million to settle allegations from\nattorneys general in three states that it paid secret\ncommissions to win business.

{"date": "16:31 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "BAGHDAD Thousands of Sunni Arabs vented their anger on Tuesday over Saddam Hussein's execution as the Iraqi government promised an investigation into illicitly filmed footage of Shi'ite officials taunting him on the gallows.A court official said he nearly halted the hanging over the jeering, which has inflamed sectarian passions in a nation already on the brink of civil war. Data showed civilian deaths hit a new record in December and were over 12,000 in 2006.He also challenged government claims those who filmed the event were guards, saying they were senior officials.In the video, widely seen on the Internet, observers chant the name of Shi'ite cleric and militia leader Moqtada al-Sadr as Saddam stands on the scaffold, a convicted mass killer appearing dignified in contrast to the uproar below him.But the government adviser who announced the investigations on Monday into the taunts and filming, accused the opposition of using them to deflect attention from Saddam's crimes: \"This is an artificial uproar,\" Sami al-Askari told state television.\"They cannot say this court has been unjust and so they take this mistake and forget Saddam deserved to be executed,\" he said. \"Saddam was treated well in court and on the scaffold.\"No one beat him or insulted him, yet Saddam tortured many Iraqis, executed thousands and buried them in mass graves.\"By rushing through the execution just four days after the former president's appeal failed, over the reservations of the U.S. ambassador who urged a two-week delay, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki made good on a promise to fellow Shi'ites that Saddam would not live to see 2007.But a moderate lawmaker from Saddam's Sunni community said the uncensored images of the hasty hanging were a blow to Maliki's calls for national reconciliation.Prosecutor Munkith al-Faroon, who can be heard appealing for order on the Internet video, said he threatened to leave the room if the jeering did not stop. That would have halted the execution as a prosecution observer must be present by law.\"I threatened to leave,\" Faroon told Reuters. \"They knew that if I left, the execution could not go ahead.\"KILLING FIELDSAs President Bush prepares a new strategy for a war in which the 3,000th soldier died at the weekend, Interior Ministry data showed at least 1,930 civilians died in political violence in December, almost certainly an underestimate.Another 45 bodies were found around Baghdad on Tuesday, police said, most apparently victims of the kind of sectarian death squads that are tearing Iraqi society apart.Saddam's grave in his native village, Awja, drew thousands more mourners on Tuesday, as it has each day since he was buried there in the dead of night early on Sunday.Thousands of people marched in nearby Tikrit and in the northern city of Mosul, carrying portraits of Saddam and banners proclaiming him a martyr. In Samarra, Sunni mourners prayed at a shrine venerated principally by Shi'ites that was destroyed by a bomb in February, unleashing the present sectarian bloodbath.Sunni neighborhoods in Baghdad and other towns have seen similar demonstrations since Saturday.The rapid execution has boosted Maliki's fragile authority among his fractious Shi'ite allies, but has angered many Sunnis.Maliki said in an interview published on Tuesday by the Wall Street Journal he has no interest in a second term and wished he could be done before the end of his current term, in which rampant sectarian violence has defied hopes for unity.Asked if he would accept a second term, he said: \"Impossible.\"\"I wish it could be done with even before the end of this term. I would like to serve my people from outside the circle of senior officials, maybe through the parliament, or through working directly with the people,\" Maliki said.As the Iraqi government mounted an investigation into how officials smuggled in mobile phone cameras, Faroon challenged the accounts of the justice minister and an adviser to the prime minister who said the illicit film was shot by a guard.\"Two officials were holding mobile phone cameras,\" said Faroon, who was a deputy prosecutor in the case for which Saddam was hanged and is the chief prosecutor in a second trial that will continue against his aides for genocide against the Kurds.\"One of them I know. He's a high-ranking government official,\" Faroon said, declining to name the man. \"The other I also know by sight, though not his name. He is also senior.\"Describing how U.S. troops searched the official delegation to attend the hanging, he said: \"I don't know how they got their mobiles in because the Americans took all our phones, even mine which has no camera.\"Khudayer al-Khuzai, the acting justice minister, said guards violated orders not to bring mobile phones or cameras. He vowed an investigation with \"highest standards of discipline.\"(Additional reporting by Alastair Macdonald)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-iraq-idUSL30803120070102", "sectors": [], "title": "saddam video inquiry promised"},

{"date": "16:32 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " (Adds layoffs, company and analyst comments) By Jonathan StempelNEW YORK Jan 2 (Reuters) - Mortgage Lenders Network USA, a\nlarge U.S. subprime lender, said it has stopped funding loans\nand accepting applications for loans, citing deteriorating\nconditions in the mortgage market, and has temporarily laid off\nabout 80 percent of its 1,800 employees. Privately held Mortgage Lenders also said it is in\n\"strategic negotiations\" with several Wall Street firms\nregarding its loan operations. Roughly four-fifths, or about 1,440, of the Middletown,\nConnecticut-based firm's employees are on \"temporary furlough,\"\nspokesman James Pedrick said in an interview. Mortgage Lenders said it has five regional lending offices\nand employs about 950 people in its home state. The retrenchment is the latest sign of stress among\nsubprime lenders, which make higher-cost loans to people with\nweaker credit histories. It comes less than a week after similar-sized rival Ownit\nMortgage Solutions Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy\nprotection. Mortgage Lenders disclosed the changes on its Web site, in\nphone recordings at several offices, and in a statement. Rising interest rates and home prices have led to growing\ncompetition for a shrinking pool of borrowers, and defaults are\nrising as the economy slows and rates reset higher. Meanwhile, some lenders have been pinched by being forced\nto buy back loans they sold because of rising delinquencies,\nand as \"warehouse\" lenders pull credit lines, analysts said. Unlike most subprime rivals, Mortgage Lenders increased its\nlending throughout 2006. It made $3.31 billion of subprime\nloans in the third quarter, ranking 15th nationwide, according\nto data from National Mortgage News. The firm, however, said wholesale market conditions have\n\"deteriorated dramatically\" in the last two months. Chief Executive Mitchell Heffernan said wholesale broker\noriginations will stop until credit quality and margins return\nto \"acceptable levels.\" The firm said it plans to maintain its\n$17.8 billion servicing portfolio. Heffernan had said on Dec. 8 that the firm viewed 2007 as a\nyear of growth, including plans to build new headquarters in\nWallingford, Connecticut. INDUSTRY STRUGGLES Mortgage Lenders' third-quarter loan volume tripled from a\nyear earlier though industrywide lending fell 9 percent. Among\nlarger subprime lenders, only Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC.N) and\nCitigroup Inc. (C.N) boosted loan volumes. David Olson, president of Wholesale Access, which tracks\nthe mortgage industry, said Mortgage Lenders' retrenchment was\nunsurprising in light of subprime lenders' struggles. \"Profits are way down, and margins are razor-thin or even\nnegative,\" he said. Pedrick said Mortgage Lenders' warehouse lines of credit\n\"have not been pulled and not been shut down.\" Last Thursday, 16th-ranked Ownit, based in Agoura Hills,\nCalifornia, listed in its bankruptcy filing more than $170\nmillion of debt, including $93 million owed to Merrill Lynch &\nCo. MER.N. Sebring Capital Partners, a Texas-based subprime lender,\nceased operations on Dec. 1, according to its Web site.

{"date": "16:43 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "NEW YORK Investors will get a final tally on holiday sales this week as retailers release December sales figures amid concerns heavy promotions used to lure customers will cut into profits.Most U.S. retailers report December sales on Thursday, while electronics retailers Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY.N) and Circuit City Stores Inc. CC.N weigh in with their sales on Friday.Industry leader Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT.N) has already said its sales rose 1.6 percent in December at U.S. stores open at least a year, according to preliminary data, beating its own forecast of flat to up 1 percent.\"We believe Wal-Mart managed to deliver its above plan 1.6 percent comp (comparable-store sales) because of an extra selling day, an easy after Christmas week comparison, and aggressive promotions as the season winded down,\" wrote Goldman Sachs analyst Adrianne Shapira in a note.But she said the \"above plan\" sales for the retailer, which aggressively promoted lower prices on electronics and toys, were likely driven by \"above plan\" markdowns, which does not bode well for fourth-quarter earnings.The impact of markdowns will also be closely monitored in the sales reports this week.\"Everyone is going to be looking to see if there's any mention within that news release of any change in earnings guidance, or anything in the language of the description of what occurred that can point toward and suggest earnings direction for Q4,\" said Bernard Sands retail analyst Richard Hastings.\"Q4 earnings is a big question mark and it looks like it's not going to be a very good quarter for a lot of retailers.\"BATTLING ELECTRONICSRetail Metrics LLC, with an index of 57 retailers, expects December same-store sales to rise 3.3 percent, compared with a 3.4 percent increase a year ago.Excluding Wal-Mart, the index forecasts a 4.6 percent gain in December same-store sales, and a 3.5 percent gain excluding Wal-Mart and drug store chains. The index does not include Best Buy or Circuit City.Electronics were brisk sellers this holiday season as prices for flat-panel televisions plunged and retailers heavily promoted TVs, digital cameras, laptop computers and MP3 players to draw shoppers into their stores.Consumer technology retail sales from the week of Black Friday -- the day after Thanksgiving -- through the week ended December 23 were $8.75 billion -- up 6.5 percent from a year ago, according to NPD Group. But this year's gain trailed last year's 10 percent revenue rise due in part to the falling prices for flat-panel TVs, the market research firm said.While promotions -- which featured 42-inch plasma TVs selling for under $1,000 during the Thanksgiving shopping weekend -- drove sales, Best Buy and Circuit City have already said it hurt their profits for the third-quarter, which ended in November.The demand for the expensive advanced TVs could also mean difficult results for apparel retailers if shoppers decided against buying that extra sweater or scarf after shelling out hundreds or thousands of dollars for a TV.Wall Street is also watching to see how retailers dealt with procrastinators.Shoppers visited stores in droves during the November Thanksgiving shopping weekend, but then paused and waited for retailers to roll out last-minute deals in December before they finished their holiday shopping.\"We definitely know that the first half of the month was slow,\" said Dana Telsey, founder of research firm Telsey Advisory Group.She said the question is: \"What was the pick-up in the second half of the month and how much did the last week add?\"Christmas fell on a Monday this year, giving shoppers a final weekend to shop ahead of the holiday.Retailers also faced unfavorable weather conditions in December. Shapira said the Goldman Sachs Rain or Shine Indicator showed the weather was 21 percent warmer this December compared with a year ago.\"Getting into the holiday spirit was tough when there was no hint of winter in the air. Those retailers waiting for weather to break had a nail biter of a month,\" she wrote.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-retail-sales-outlook-idUSN0232286620070102", "sectors": [["Markets"]], "title": "divining fourth - quarter earnings from december sales"},

Blige, comedian Chris Rock, actor Sydney Poitier and filmmaker Spike Lee attended the star-studded school launch.FAILING SCHOOLS\"The future is so bright for them it burns my eyes. They want to be presidents and doctors. We don't tell the girls to become anything but their own best self,\" said Winfrey.Activists criticize the South African government for neglecting public schools particularly in poor and rural areas where classrooms are often overcrowded and inadequately funded.High levels of classroom violence, teenage pregnancy and drug abuse exacerbate the poor standard of education.Winfrey said she hoped a better education could shield South Africa girls from contracting HIV, a disease that affects an estimated 5.5 million of South Africa's 45 million people.\"Girls who are educated are less likely to get HIV/AIDS, and in this country which has such a pandemic, we have to begin to change the pandemic,\" she said.While authorities seek to expand a program to waive school fees for some of the poorest South Africans, many believe that the legacy of apartheid-era laws remain a disadvantage for underprivileged black students.Private schools are, in large part, reserved for white pupils whose parents can afford tuition payments.The first batch of 152 mostly black students, chosen from thousands of applicants, will eventually be followed by another 300 girls between Grades 7 and 12, Winfrey said.Admission criteria mean the family of each girl must earn less than 60,000 rand ($8,663) annually to get their foot in the door. After that, pupils were hand-picked by Winfrey for displaying strong leadership qualities in interviews.Tuition and board is free at the residential school.\"Where we live there are lots of gangsters and I want to change all of that,\" Noxolo Buthelezi, 13, said in her new school uniform -- a forest green pleated skirt and jacket and collared white shirt.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-safrica-winfrey-education-idUSL023073220070102", "sectors": [["Entertainment, ", "People"]], "title": "oprah opens academy for poor girls in south africa"},

Jackson praised Brown as an inspiration after being invited \nto the stage by Sharpton during his eulogy of \"the godfather of \nsoul.\" \"I don't care what the media says tonight, James Brown \nwanted Michael Jackson with him here today,\" Sharpton said in a \nbooming voice. \"He said ... 'I love Michael.' He said, 'Tell him don't \nworry about coming home. They always scandalize those that have \nthe talent. But tell him we need to clean up the music and I \nwant Michael and all of them that imitated me to come back and \nlift the music back.\"' Jackson, who has been living abroad since being found not \nguilty of molestation charges in California in June 2005, \ncalled Brown \"my greatest inspiration.\" He told the audience of \n9,000 at the James Brown Arena that from the age of 6 his \nmother would make him watch television whenever Brown came on \nto perform. \"When I saw him move I was mesmerized,\" Jackson, 48, said. \n\"I've never seen a performer perform like James Brown and right \nthen and there I knew that that was what I wanted to do for the \nrest of my life. \"James Brown, I shall miss you and I love you so much. \nThank you for everything,\" said Jackson, who wore a black \nleather jacket, black pants and sunglasses. Jackson was a child star with the Jackson 5 on the Motown \nrecord label and achieved global fame as a solo artist. His \n\"Thriller\" album in 1982 became a smash hit selling 27 million \nunits worldwide and yielding seven top-ten singles.

{"date": "18:14 30 December 2006 (UTC)", "text": "AUGUSTA, Georgia Civil rights leaders, \nentertainers and fans turned out in force on Saturday at a \nfunky funeral for James Brown, whose music and message embodied \na generation of revolutionary change for black Americans. Even singer Michael Jackson made a rare public appearance, \nentering the funeral to massive applause as Brown's band, The \nSoul Generals, performed Brown's old hits to an overwhelmingly \nblack crowd of 9,000. Brown's body lay in an open-topped golden coffin in front \nof the stage at the James Brown Arena, which was renamed in \nhonor of Augusta's most famous native son in August. He died of \ncongestive heart failure on Christmas Day at the age of 73. The legendary showman, known as the \"Godfather of Soul,\" \nwas dressed in a black suit and gloves with a ruby red shirt. \nJewels sparkled on his lapels and the tips of his shoes. It was his third costume change in three days, CNN \nreported, following a private funeral on Friday and a viewing \nof his body at the Apollo Theater in New York the day before. Brown's music, with its staccato horns and guitars and his \noften explosive vocals, brought funk into the mainstream and \nhas influenced pop and dance music since the 1950s. Hip-hop \nartists revere him, often using his beats in their own songs. \"The whole world changed their beat because of James \nBrown,\" civil rights leader Al Sharpton said in a eulogy. \n\"Nobody started lower and ended higher than James Brown did.\" In a brief speech Jackson, who wore a black leather jacket, \nblack pants and sunglasses, said he'd watched Brown perform on \ntelevision as a 6-year-old and was \"mesmerized,\" deciding right \nthen to follow in Brown's fancy footsteps. \"James Brown is my greatest inspiration,\" said Jackson, who \nhas spent little time in the United States since being \nacquitted of child molestation charges in 2005.\n BLACK AND PROUD Much of the emphasis at the funeral was on Brown's politics \nand his passionate advocacy of civil rights, the movement that \noverturned a brutal system of racial segregation that grew out \nof slavery and prevailed in southern U.S. states until the \n1960s. Brown's 1968 song \"Say It Loud (I'm Black and I'm Proud)\" \nbecame an anthem for the civil rights and Black Power movements \nand Brown became a symbol of black achievement. In a passionate speech, comedian and activist Dick Gregory \nreminded the audience of the oppressive racial environment of \nBrown's early life rather than simply focusing on his music. \"We didn't get this (civil rights) out of the goodness of \nAmerica's heart,\" he said. \"We didn't get this because they \nsent the Marines in ... We got this because with love and \nwilling to die we said, 'We gonna change it.\"' That sentiment was echoed in interviews by many fans. \"James Brown in my opinion is the greatest singer of all \ntime and I am his number one fan,\" said Jesse Williamson, 59, \nwho said he first saw Brown perform in 1963. Williamson said his own youth was \"a humiliating time (to \nbe black) but as time went on Martin Luther King, James Brown \nand others made a difference\" in overcoming segregation. Rapper M.C. Hammer and bass player Bootsy Collins also \nattended the funeral and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson gave \na closing address. Some fans waited from 9 p.m. on Friday for the start of the \npublic viewing of Brown's body and many people crowded outside \nthe packed arena unable to get in. Brown was born in South Carolina and and began his musical \ncareer while a juvenile offender in jail. He later settled in Augusta, also known for the Master's \ngolf tournament. The city has erected a statue of Brown, who \nearned a reputation for charitable giving and eating at local \nrestaurants. Brown's personal life was turbulent and in 1988 he was \njailed for three years for drug and weapons charges. He had 119 hits including \"Please, Please, Please,\" \"Papa's \nGot a Brand New Bag,\" \"It's a Man's, Man's, Man's World\" and \n\"Living in America\" but his musical influence outweighed his \nchart success. Brown, who insisted on being called Mr. Brown, styled \nhimself \"the hardest-working man in show business\" and \nperformed more than 100 live shows this year. He was due to \nperform on New Year's Eve in New York's Times Square.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/people-usa-brown-funeral-dc-idUSN3028811820070102", "sectors": [["U.S., ", "Entertainment, ", "Music, ", "People"]], "title": "stars , fans pack arena for james brown funeral"},

{"date": "15:54 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "NEW YORK The number of U.S. securities fraud \nclass-action lawsuits dropped last year, a study released on \nTuesday found, even as investors pursued a new avenue of \nlitigation involving the timing of stock options grants at big \ncompanies. Federal securities fraud class actions plunged 38 percent \nto 110 last year based on filings through December 11, compared \nwith 178 lawsuits in 2005 and as many as 267 in 2002, according \nto a study by Stanford Law School and Cornerstone Research, a \nresearch firm for litigators. Filings are at the lowest level since Congress passed a \nmajor class-action reform law in 1995, the study said. The declines come even as a new area emerged for investor \nlawsuits -- fraud cases related to options awarded to top \ncorporate executives. Twenty options-related lawsuits were \nfiled in 2006 against companies such as Apple Computer Inc. \n(AAPL.O), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH.N) and Juniper Networks JNPR.O. There is no single reason for the overall drop, but \nincreased corporate enforcement activity by the U.S. Securities \nand Exchange Commission and the Justice Department is a likely \nexplanation, said Stanford law professor Joseph Grundfest. \"One explanation is that there is simply less fraud in the \nmarket,\" he said. The stock market also has been strong \nrecently, though \"it will take us several years to figure out \nwhether that is really the cause of the decline,\" he added. The report comes as class-action lawyers are under heavy \nfire from business interest groups and politicians who argue \nthat shareholder litigation is growing out of control. Class-action lawyers have been dealt some big blows, \nincluding a December ruling by a federal appeals court that \nsaid 12 securities firms will not have to face a class-action \nsuit accusing them of manipulating the pricing of initial \npublic offerings in the late 1990s. The report released on Tuesday found that when class-action \nsuits are filed, the dollar amounts at stake are often smaller \nthan they were in prior years. Alleged investor losses, \nmeasured by stock market declines at the time the fraud \nallegations were disclosed, fell 44 percent to $52 billion in \n2006, from $93 billion in 2005. Proponents of class-action reform say the report shows no \nevidence that the trends are here to stay. In a statement, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said that \n\"although we applaud the decrease in filings, there is still a \nlong way to go to fix a broken securities litigation system, in \nwhich shareholders basically end up suing themselves with the \nlawyers raking huge sums off the top.\" Separately on Tuesday, a survey of large U.S. companies \nfrom BTI Consulting Group found that these businesses spent \n$56.4 billion on outside counsel last year, up 19.6 percent \nfrom 2005. The Chamber of Commerce said the fall-off in lawsuits can \npartially be attributed to the travails of once dominant \nclass-action litigation firm Milberg Weiss Bershad & Schulman \nLLP, which was indicted in May on criminal charges that it paid \nkickbacks to plaintiffs. Milberg, which has denied the charges, filed 73 fewer cases \nin 2006 than in 2005, according to the Chamber of Commerce. But the study from Stanford and Cornerstone said the \nMilberg indictment probably had no big impact on the overall \ndecline in class-action lawsuits. \"There is no shortage of plaintiffs' lawyers in the United \nStates and there are no barriers to entry,\" Grundfest said. \n\"All of the lawyers that know how to file these cases are still \nin business.\" While the number of new class actions is declining, another \nreport released on Tuesday showed that the size of settlements \nof existing cases is getting bigger. The report from NERA \nEconomic Consulting said that the average shareholder \nclass-action settlement rose to $86.7 million last year, up \nfrom $73.6 million in 2005.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/businesspro-law-classactions-dc-idUSN0234826920070102", "sectors": [["Regulatory News, ", "Bonds"]], "title": "u . s . securities class - actions down sharply : study"},

The Taliban will inflict heavy casualties on them,\" Dadullah told Reuters by satellite telephone from an undisclosed location.Dadullah did not refer to the death last month of Akhtar Mohammad Osmani, the most senior Taliban commander to be killed by U.S. forces since 2001.Osmani was killed in a U.S. air strike in the south, and another rebel commander, who declined to be identified, said earlier his death would be a blow to the Taliban.About 40,000 foreign troops are in Afghanistan, some 32,000 of them under NATO command. They are trying to ensure enough security to enable development projects to get started.Dadullah said the Taliban had used a winter lull in fighting to draw up new war plans to inflict maximum damage on foreign forces. Afghan fighting traditionally falls off during the bitter winter when snow blocks mountain passes.\"They will soon come to know about the Taliban's strength and war strategy. We will attack with such a force they will have no time to settle,\" Dadullah said.The rebel commander ruled out any negotiations while foreign troops were in the country and threatened dire consequences for anyone who did so.\"Those who negotiate in the name of the Taliban will be killed,\" he said. He did not elaborate.The government has a reconciliation program aimed at persuading Taliban members to give up their fight and rejoin society but few insurgents have taken up the offer.Some Afghan politicians have said peace will be impossible unless elements of the Taliban are included in talks.A Taliban spokesman said last month the rebels might take part in planned tribal councils that Pakistan and Afghanistan aim to hold on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistani border.But other Taliban members quickly denied there was any chance of the insurgents attending the councils. Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar was reported to have denounced the proposed meetings as an American trick in a message last week.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-afghan-taliban-idUSISL14879620070102", "sectors": [["World"]], "title": "taliban commander vows bloody 2007 in afghanistan"},

This year, businesses will add staff and lease more space, \nhelped by an economy that will strike a balance between \nrecession and inflationary expansion, according to the 2007 \nGlobal Real Estate Forecast from real estate company Grubb & \nEllis Co. GBE.N. About 300,000 of the year's expected new jobs will be \nlocated in office buildings, the report said. Rental rates for the most prestigious buildings should rise \nby 5 percent or more in 20 central business districts including \nthose in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles -- expected to be the \ntwo top U.S. office markets through 2011, the report predicted. \"The future of the office market looks bright,\" said Grubb \n& Ellis vice president Robert Bach in a statement. \"Business \ncapital spending and the expanding global economy will power \ndemand for space even if the U.S. economy remains sluggish in \nthe first half of 2007 as expected.\" In the industrial market, however, demand for space is \nexpected to fall 17.6 percent from a year ago to 140 million \nsquare feet. If the weak housing market constrained consumer \nspending and puts pressure on retailers, demand for retail \ndistribution centers could drop, possibly handicapping the \nindustrial market further, the report said. Construction companies shrinking in response to the housing \ndownturn could also result in a decreased demand for industrial \nspace. Yet demand for industrial space remains high in popular \nmarkets such as Los Angeles County, named the nation's No. 1 \nindustrial market in the report. Los Angeles has the lowest \nindustrial vacancy rate in the country, and Grubb & Ellis \nprojects double-digit rent growth there in 2007. Washington, D.C.'s fast-growing median income puts it at \nthe top of the report's list of retail markets as well. Overall, however, the retail market is expected to \nexperience a slight drop in construction this year, the report \nsaid. Until home construction and sales improve, retail \ndevelopment in new neighborhoods could slow, the report said. On the other hand, the housing downturn should boost the \nmarket for apartments and cause apartment rental rates to rise \nmodestly, according to the report.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/businesspro-grubbellis-report-dc-idUSN0233196220070102", "sectors": [["Bonds"]], "title": "office rents to rise on healthy economy : report"},

Reports said 12 people had survived the crash.\"The location has not been found. We apologize that the news that we conveyed was not true,\" First Air Marshal Eddy Suyanto, commander of Hasanuddin air base in Makassar, told reporters.\"It's not true that the crash location has been found,\" Transport Minister Hatta Radjasa told the same news conference, held less than an hour after another in which he had talked about difficulties in reaching what was thought to be the site.\"We found nothing when we arrived at the location,\" Suyanto added.The plane lost contact with the ground on Monday about an hour before it was due to land in Manado in North Sulawesi, the transport ministry said.The plane was carrying 96 passengers and six crew. A copy of its manifest showed three passengers as non-Indonesians. The United States embassy in Jakarta said they were Americans.The plane went missing just two days after a ferry carrying more than 600 people sank in bad weather off the main island of Java. At least 200 were saved and rescuers were still finding survivors on Tuesday, but some 400 were still unaccounted for.CONFUSIONSuyanto had earlier told Radio Elshinta an air force plane had spotted the wreckage of the Boeing, and a spokesman for Adam Air said 12 people had survived and would be evacuated.In another twist, transport minister Radjasa had already cast doubt on the survivors' report, saying it was based on comments from villagers and could not be confirmed.Relatives of passengers anxiously awaiting news in Makassar reacted to the new developments with shock and dismay.\"It was said that the search and rescue team had seen the aircraft. We are confused whom we should trust,\" Toni Toliu, 48, from Manado told Reuters. His sister and her two children were on the plane.Sopiana de Fretes, 49, related to an army official on the plane, said: \"Since I got here, the news has been conflicting. It's like we don't get the news that we are supposed to get.\"Officials said the search would now continue at other sites, concentrating in areas of western Sulawesi from where distress signals had been picked up on Monday before contact with the plane was lost.Searchers face bad weather conditions and rough, jungle terrain.A spokesman for Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono had issued a statement in Jakarta, shortly before news broke that the plane had not been found, saying the president wanted a full investigation into what went wrong.\"The president orders the transportation minister to evaluate and investigate this accident. The president also asked for an evaluation and investigation on the airworthiness of the plane and standard procedure on airplane operations,\" the statement said.Thus far transport officials have insisted the Boeing was airworthy and had no record of trouble.The transport ministry said it had last evaluated the plane in December 2005, when it had passed all service checks. The 17-year-old aircraft was due to be checked again in late January.The Boeing had 45,371 flying hours and, according to Adam Air, was powered by General Electric CFM56-3C1 engines.Air travel in Indonesia, home to 220 million people, has grown substantially since the liberalization of the airline industry after the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, which enabled privately owned budget airlines to operate.Adam Air was established in 2002 by Agung Laksono, speaker of Indonesia's parliament and chairman of the company, and Sandra Ang.

South Korea has the death penalty although it is considering abolishing it.However, his special representative in Iraq, Ashraf Qazi, released a statement saying that the world body \"remains opposed to capital punishment, even in the case of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.\"Ban said the crisis in Sudan's Darfur region was \"very high on my agenda\" and he would meet with his special envoy Jan Eliasson of Sweden on Wednesday morning and had already spoken by telephone with him.He also announced he would attend an African Union summit at the end of January in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and talk to Sudan's President Omar Hassan al-Bashir there.\"By engaging myself in the diplomatic process I hope that we will be able to resolve peacefully as soon as possible on these serious issues,\" Ban said.The United Nations is seeking to get a peacekeeping force in Sudan's western arid Darfur region, where violence has escalated, rapes have multiplied and more than 2.5 million people have lost their homes.

But at the time, Ford was assailed for it and lost the 1976 election to Democrat Jimmy Carter.Carter, now 82, attended the memorial service along with the remaining former presidents, Bill Clinton, 60, and Bush's father, George H.W. Bush, 82.\"President Ford's time in office was brief, but history will long remember the courage and common sense that helped restore trust in the workings of our democracy,\" Bush said.Or as his father put it: \"Jerry Ford's decency was the ideal remedy for the deception of Watergate,\" the scandal that drove Nixon to resign the presidency.With the Iraq war looming as a source of Washington combat in 2007, a political truce was in effect for a national day of mourning for Ford, whose body later was flown to Grand Rapids, Michigan, for burial.CRITICISM OF THE IRAQ WARIn the Washington audience were many critics of Bush's Iraq policy. Seated near Bush in the front pew was Carter, a frequent critic. Honorary pallbearers included Brent Scowcroft, who was former President Bush's national security adviser and cautioned him against sending U.S. troops into Baghdad in the first Gulf War in 1991.Nearby was former Secretary of State James Baker, whose Iraq Study Group report offering Bush recommendations for changing course in Iraq seems to have largely been ignored by Bush as he considers a change in policy to be announced soon.Elsewhere were former Secretary of State Colin Powell, who has been critical of Iraq, as well as former Vice President Al Gore.Even Ford himself had managed to get some criticism of the Iraq war on the record from beyond the grave, telling The Washington Post's Bob Woodward that \"I don't think I would have gone to war.\" The 2004 and 2005 interviews were not published until after Ford's death.Bush, who sees himself as having a bit of Harry Truman's feistiness and firmness despite low public support, said Ford took office \"because America needed him, not because he wanted the office,\" at a time of economic inflation and political turmoil and the end of the Vietnam War.\"Amid all the turmoil, Gerald Ford was a rock of stability,\" Bush said.Speakers, including former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former NBC television anchor Tom Brokaw, praised Ford for bringing small-town American values to the White House.Brokaw said Ford stood in deep contrast to other politicians, without mentioning Nixon or others by name.\"Gerald Ford brought to the political arena no demons, no hidden agenda, no hit list or acts of vengeance. He knew who he was, and he didn't require consultants or gurus to change him,\" he said.Kissinger said Ford deserved credit for helping end the Cold War. Former President Bush recalled Ford's foibles on the golf course:\"'I know I'm playing better golf,'\" President Ford once reported to friends, 'because I'm hitting fewer spectators.'\"", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-ford-funeral-idUSN0233068120070102", "sectors": [["Politics"]], "title": "ex - u . s . president ford called rock of stability"},
{"date": "17:38 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "CHICAGO Doctors can follow a set of guidelines to identify sick children who might have a deadly form of meningitis, sparing young patients days in the hospital, researchers said on Tuesday.Meningitis produces swelling of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The bacterial form that occurs in one in 25 cases can produce a more severe illness than the viral form.Doctors often cannot determine which type of meningitis a patient has until a bacterial culture is produced in the laboratory -- requiring up to a three-day wait. Just in case, most patients are admitted to the hospital and treated with powerful antibiotics.But guidelines developed four years ago and recently tested in a trial of 3,300 patients aged 29 days to 19 years correctly classified all but two patients, both of whom were younger than 2 months and more difficult to diagnose, according to the study published in this week's issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.The criteria include routine tests of blood and fluids and a checklist, including whether the child has had seizures since falling ill.\"The ability to identify those children who are at very low risk of bacterial meningitis and can be considered for management on an outpatient basis will avoid unnecessary hospitalization and aggressive antibiotic therapy,\" said study author Dr. Nathan Kuppermann of the University of California-Davis Medical Center.A vaccine to combat bacterial meningitis has been recommended in the United States for at-risk children younger than 2 since 2000, reducing the incidence of the disease, the report said.\"The finding is important because it gives emergency room physicians nationwide a tool to guide their decision-making when caring for children with suspected meningitis, a serious and potentially life-threatening infection,\" said study co-author Lise Nigrovic of Children's Hospital Boston.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-meningitis-idUSN0234382520070102", "sectors": [["Health"]], "title": "guidelines help diagnose severe meningitis : study"},
{"date": "17:52 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Call it the year of smoke and mirrors. When 2006 began, fearful studio executives were still reeling with the first down year in DVD history. They were anxiously looking for salvation, and hoping to find it in high-definition discs, digital downloads or perhaps a combination of the two.The next generation of software did launch in 2006, regrettably with two incompatible formats, first HD-DVD in April and then Blu-ray Disc in June. Digital downloading began as well, with all the big Hollywood studios aggressively selling their hot new movies on Movielink, CinemaNow, Apple's iTunes and other download services. Studio executives even coined a new term, \"electronic sell-through,\" or EST, for the lucrative business model.But in the end, none of these technological marvels really mattered. High-def discs still are a blip on the sales radar, and digital downloading are even less of a blip. And lo and behold, what saved the day for home entertainment was an unexpected resurgence in the DVD market, fueled by a powerful slate of summer theatricals.\"What we're looking at is a market that is up slightly from last year, overall,\" said David Bishop, president of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. \"But if you break down the components, we're projecting DVD sales to be up 3 percent, year-over-year, and rental to be up about 12 percent. What drags the industry down to a flat or slightly up basis is that VHS sales and rentals are virtually going away.\"\"The industry is up as a whole, despite a decrease in overall pricing,\" added Kelley Avery, president of worldwide home entertainment at Paramount Pictures. \"Contrary to popular belief, reports of the decline of DVD have been exaggerated.\"Much of the optimism floating around the studio DVD divisions stems from the exceptionally strong fourth quarter. Things got off to a good start when Fox's \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" and Disney's \"The Little Mermaid Platinum Edition\" generated $80 million in consumer spending in a single day. Further triumphs came as the quarter progressed, culminating this month when Disney's \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\" sold 10.5 million DVDs its first week in stores, putting it on track to become the top-selling live-action DVD ever.The fourth-quarter DVD sales rally was probably the biggest home entertainment story of 2006, even though it didn't make the biggest headlines. That honor went to the launch of the two high-def disc formats and the flurry of major studio deals with digital downloading services.On the packaged-media front, the launch of two rival, incompatible formats was, if not a disaster, a major disappointment. But the real culprit, and the reason software sales have been anemic (fewer than 10,000 units of even a really big title are typical), wasn't so much a lack of a unified standard. It was the fact that consumer electronics manufacturers really dropped the ball, with a series of delays that really pinged adoption rates. The HD-DVD camp never got beyond two Toshiba models, including an entry-level model retailing for $499, while only at the very end of the year did Blu-ray get additional players to join the $999 Samsung model that arrived in stores in late June.\"Everyone was disappointed in the quantity (of players) that came out of the electronics companies,\" said Warner Home Video president Ron Sanders. \"But what is encouraging is that the attach rate of the software was amazingly high. On average, consumers bought 28 to 30 movies per set-top box, and that's just below what it was for DVD in the same time frame.\"Digital downloading, simmering on the back burner for several years, also had its official coming out in April when five of the six major studios begin selling downloads of their movies over the Internet, through services Movielink and CinemaNow. New releases went out day-and-date with the DVDs. Holdout Disney soon joined the party, and by year's end, the two dedicated download services were joined by a wide variety of others, including Apple's iTunes, Amazon.com and file-swapping service BitTorrent. The only hitch was that in most cases, downloaded movies could not be burned to standard DVDs for easy transport into the living room.In the retail world, the mass merchants continued to clobber each other over price and exclusive gifts with purchase on hot new theatrical DVD releases, while two veteran audio-video combo chains, Musicland and Tower Records and Video, bit the dust. The former was acquired by Trans World Entertainment after filing for bankruptcy, while Tower was liquidated.So what lies ahead for 2007? For starters, studio presidents expect big things from high-def discs. The prognosis for 2007 is that one of the two rival formats will fall by the wayside, consumer electronics makers will rally and start cranking out players, the Chinese will weigh in with cheap players of their own and by the fourth quarter, high-def discs will be a viable, significant business.\"Consumers are buying more high-definition TVs than ever before,\" said Craig Kornblau, president of Universal Studios Home Entertainment. And once they get hooked on high-definition entertainment through digital cable, he said, consumers are going to want, even expect, high-def content from all their media, spurring demand for high-def discs.The digital download market, too, is expected to grow significantly, particularly with the prospect that consumers will be able to burn downloaded movies onto DVDs playable in their set-top units. CinemaNow introduced the download-to-burn option on select catalog titles during the summer, but this year the gates are expected to be thrust wide open.Depending on how well the summer theatrical features fare at the box office, studio chiefs say 2007 could be a very good year, overall, for home entertainment.Reuters/Hollywood Reporter", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-dvd-idUSN0221900520070102", "sectors": [["Entertainment, ", "Film"]], "title": "strong summer movies drive dvds to ' 06 rally"},

The month's tax revenue of 14.12 billion pesos ($4.57\nbillion) was just below the median forecast of 14.20 billion\npesos by seven local and international analysts surveyed last\nweek by Reuters. Their estimates ranged between 13.26 billion\nand 15.13 billion pesos. The government also said tax receipts had reached a record\n150.01 billion pesos in 2006 -- an increase of 25.8 percent on\n2005. Alberto Abad, the head of the South American country's tax\nagency, told a news conference the annual collection figure\nwould represent 23.2 percent of gross domestic product. \"The earnings obtained from value-added tax, companies'\nstaff-linked contributions and taxes on earnings explain 69\npercent of the growth in tax receipts,\" he said. Argentina, Latin America's No. 3 economy, is on track to\ngrow strongly for the fourth straight year, recovering from\ndeep crisis in 2001-02. In the first 10 months of 2006, the\nArgentine economy expanded by 8.5 percent. \"The target was exceeded due to the greater-than-expected\neconomic activity and an improvement in tax-paying compliance,\"\nthe tax agency said in a statement. In its budget for 2006, the government of President Nestor\nKirchner originally forecast a tax revenue of 132.4 billion\npesos based on economic growth of 4 percent. However, it later upwardly revised its outlook for the tax\ntake.

{"date": "18:22 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "BEERSHEBA, Israel An Israeli firm has designed a security system to ensure jailbreakers or intruders find a guard dog's bark can indeed be worse than its bite.Harnessing technology that interprets barking -- to see if an animal is responding to a threat instead of just routinely woofing -- the company aims to replace or supplement expensive electronic surveillance systems.\"There is currently very little utilization of the watchdog's early warning capabilities,\" says privately owned manufacturer Bio-Sense Technologies, based in the Israeli town of Petah Tikva, on its Web site.The company -- which says dogs have better night vision than humans and a vastly superior sense of smell and hearing -- used computers to analyze 350 barks and found dogs of all breeds and sizes barked the same alarm when they sensed a threat.If the dogs sense an intruder or attempted security breach, dozens of sensors around the facility pick up their \"alarm bark\" and alert the human operators in the control room.Dubbed \"Doguard\", the Dog Bio Security system is in place in high-security Eshel Prison as well as Israeli military bases, water installations, farms, ranches, garages and in Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank.Eshel Prison installed the system last year to supplement its existing network of electric fences and human guards, prison officer Bazov Moris told Reuters.Now Rex, a brown American Staffordshire Terrier, Emmy, a white Caanan, and 27 other dogs guarding the prison are tracked by sensors to alert guards to any attempted breakout at the jail, which houses about 3,000 prisoners including Israelis and Palestinians.There have been no escape attempts since the system was installed, but Moris is convinced it works. He said prisoners at other facilities had been able to escape \"because dogs barked but no alert was sent to the guards\".During a demonstration an alarm wailed as Rex and Emmy raced, growling and snarling, alongside one of the facility's metal fences, which a man in a brown uniform was trying to scale from the other side.Officers in a small basement office nearby watched on a surveillance video and spoke into their walkie-talkies as a wall of computer screens flashed in red: \"Dog alarm in Sector 12\".Seconds later, several prison guards, wielding clubs, raced to the scene and tackled the man to the ground.NOT FOOLPROOFThe dog bark-reader is just one of a batch of innovative security systems to emerge from Israel, which business magazine Forbes said in December had emerged as \"the go-to country for anti-terrorism technologies\".By monitoring not just the dogs' barks, but also their physiological responses -- like heart rates -- it joins a trend for computer systems building on animal knowledge that humans also share.Another Israeli example, from Suspect Detection Systems, offers border checkpoints a computer quiz that alerts guards if travellers show a marked physiological response to particularly tough questions.However, Doguard is not foolproof. When first set up at Eshel Prison and at a water installation and farm in central Israel, the dogs triggered several false alarms, officials said.\"The dogs need two to three weeks to adapt -- they must get to know their territory,\" said Daniel Low, chief executive officer of Meniv Rishon, the municipal water system of the Israeli town of Rishon Lezion.Low said he had installed the system in several places to replace guards.Galia Alon, an official at Modi'in Ezrahi, a large Israeli security company that supplies private guards and equipment, cautioned against relying on dogs as a first line of defense.\"Dogs are excellent at spotting intruders -- they are well trained and have a more sharpened sense of smell than humans,\" she said. \"But people can identify people by looking at them and talking to them, and they are more inclined to catch them.\"Yossi Brami, manager of a dairy at Kibbutz Gezer, a communal farm, had the system installed two months ago.

He says he could make much more money giving up his mostly low-value businesses and renting out the spaces to foreign luxury brands.\"But then what else would I do with my days?\" he said.FOREIGNERS COMPLAINTraders say jeans company Lee Cooper was the first international brand to move in the early 1990s, when India began to open up its economy to foreign investment.Lee Cooper has since left, but clothing brands Levi Strauss & Co., Nike and the United Colours of Benetton, along with Subway and McDonald's restaurants, are some of the dozen or so international companies to be found here.Swarovski, the Austrian crystal company, had been trying to get into Khan Market for more than three years before it bagged a tenancy here in April.The company pays 350,000 rupees ($7,830) a month in rent for 434 square feet of shop space, said Vishnu Sharma, one of Swarovski's Indian partners. He wishes he got smarter surroundings for the money.\"They do complain about how the market is so shabby looking, or foreign customers do anyway,\" he said. \"Indians are used to it ... I would love to see Khan Market look more like Fifth Avenue.\"But Sheila Dikshit, Delhi's chief minister, says she is in no rush to see it made over.\"It may not be very chic or smart,\" she told Reuters, \"but it's got a warmth you don't find in many places any more.\"", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-india-property-shopping-idUSDEL30195620070102", "sectors": [], "title": "buckets , fine crystal for sale on india ' s 5th avenue"},

The total mall space currently available in these cities is around 12.4 million square feet.Foreign Investments:In 2005-06, the real estate sector tapped 16 percent of the $5.54 billion of foreign investment attracted to India, compared to 10.6 percent of the $3.75 billion foreign investment in India in 2004-05.Morgan Stanley's real estate investment arm has invested $68 million in Mantri Developers Private Ltd. which is based in Bangalore, while JP Morgan Chase's Principal Real Estate Investments has invested $60 million in a residential project in Mumbai with Lodha Builders.Hilton International Corp. plans to invest $143 million for a 26 percent stake in the joint venture company with domestic real estate firm DLF Universal Ltd for hotel and real estate activities.India's first property trust is due to be launched early next year when business park developer Embassy group spins off buildings in a Singapore IPO.Roadblocks:Investors betting on the sector have to bear the cumbersome bureaucracy.

{"date": "18:26 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "MUMBAI Up a flight of creaky wooden stairs, young Indian real estate agent Hemant Surve guides a prospective renter around a damp two-bedroom apartment overlooking the sea in the country's teeming financial capital.Flaking paint and dilapidated toilets leave his client, an American expatriate from New York, distinctly unimpressed but Surve says its dysfunctional plumbing and dour color scheme is all she will get for her budget of $2,500 a month -- plus bills.\"Many are willing to pay anything for a flat like this,\" Surve says as he gestures at a bare sitting room, whose arched windows open on to a heap of ugly road construction material and huge cranes.As global firms and some of their overseas staff flock to India to tap opportunities in its burgeoning economy, premium residential rents in cities like Mumbai and the capital, New Delhi, are going through the roof.Add a rising number of high-income Indian professionals and a shift to a nuclear family from the traditional extended one, and the number of people looking for good homes is pushing rents to levels seen in the more desirable parts of London and New York.\"Mumbai is drawing big luxury liners and small ships alike,\" said Sandeep Sadh, chief executive of online real estate firm www.realestatemumbai.com.\"Be it an expat worker or an Indian professional, the mind-boggling demand for high-end rented homes will continue.\"THE I.T. GENERATIONWhile residential rents have gone up across the board, they have surged 31 percent in the last quarter in Mumbai's top-end areas like the financial district of Nariman Point, named as one of the world's 10 most expensive locations in a recent CB Richard Ellis survey.Tenants drawn from banks, information technology companies, securities traders and headhunters are driving the market in the city of 17 million people, property dealers say.In New Delhi, upmarket southern suburbs have seen rents appreciate by 30 percent in each of the last two quarters.\"Values in New Delhi will remain buoyant as there will be no substantial supply in the next 12-15 months,\" said a consultant with real estate firm Knight Frank. \"The demand-supply situation in the premium segment is the same in Mumbai and New Delhi.\"In Bangalore, home to major IT firms, property prices have risen as much as 50-60 percent in the past six months, but have since fallen and stabilized at a rise of about 15 percent after new construction met part of the huge demand.The high-end property market in India's financial capital Mumbai is witnessing a bizarre drama, where rents for some two-bedroom apartment can either match those in New York or Tokyo, or cost only a few dollars.The cause is a six-decade-old rent control law - framed to insulate tenants from unscrupulous landlords - which millions of renters use to hold a large chunk of prime property, paying rents at 1940s prices.The politically popular law has been extended more than 20 times and currently applies to roughly 60 per cent of the thousands of buildings in the city center.Landlords, who can not raise rents or redevelop their assets without the permission of tenants, have watched helplessly as market prices have soared and their properties have disintegrated.\"A change in the rent laws will free up a lot of premium properties, most of them commercial,\" said Sadh.\"Thousands of properties could be available but even then it wouldn't be enough to meet the demand in the residential segment.\"POOR AMENITIES, INFRASTRUCTUREMumbai's high-end rental property mainly comprises decaying once-glamorous Art Deco apartment blocks, lining a seafront sweep in the south of the city.In many such buildings, where rents can range from $2,000-5,000 plus bills, modern amenities are absent and even the lifts can be unsafe, pulley-worked contraptions from the 1960s.Real estate developers and brokers say a combination of archaic tenancy laws, restrictive regulations for new buildings and shoddy infrastructure underlie many of the problems.A lot of the properties are so old that their owners are long dead. With property titles unclear, builders avoid getting involved in evicting old tenants.The pressure on the high-end property market has forced companies and individuals to look at the city's northern suburbs, which are also seeing a rise in rentals and capital values.But poor infrastructure connecting these northern suburbs to the rest of the city is a problem.\"The government has so far failed to maintain, develop or strengthen infrastructure in a city which has grown by leaps and bounds in the past few years,\" said an official of mumbaipropertyexchange.com, a leading real estate agency.Real estate experts say prices will stabilize once the government delivers on a promise to finally build a modern travel infrastructure for the city.\"Once we have the bridges, the roads and the underground railway, we will see prices peak out,\" said Sadh.\"If we can cut down on travel time, people don't mind living a little further away from town.\"", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-india-property-rent-idUSSP28561220070102", "sectors": [], "title": "rents go through the roof in india ' s top cities"},

The competition, run by community leaders, concluded with the final knockout rounds on December 30.The sport, which began three centuries ago among young bored farmhands of the Venda tribe, attracts scores of spectators who often walk miles to cheer their favorites under the searing summer sun.Fights are virtually mob scenes, with winners and losers emerging from the ring bruised and bloodied, and onlookers shouting their approval or dismay at the results.Men in wide-brimmed hats and tank tops crouch at the ringside, shouting over who should be the next combatants.Volunteers, ranging from children as young as five to pensioners, are randomly chosen from surrounding villages to fight, until one of them is either knocked out or surrenders.Women are excluded from the competition.\"The fight is very rough.

{"date": "18:33 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "ISTANBUL As the magnitude of an earthquake in a television advert gradually mounts, the stone letters ISTANBUL crack, and then crumble to dust.If it seems alarmist, builder Cuneyt Kilic, whose company AKS Anatolian Housing is behind the graphic depicting the collapse of Turkey's largest city, says it is merely realistic.Many scientists agree the question is not if, but when in the next three decades a major earthquake will hit Istanbul, the former seat of the Byzantine and Ottoman empires and source of more than half Turkey's industrial output.Turkey's top seismologist said in November \"the big one\" could kill more than 100,000 people.Turkey lies on a major fault line and has had 90 earthquakes higher than magnitude 5 since 1903, including one in August 1999 when nearly 18,000 people were killed.Of those deaths 1,000 were in Istanbul, and many were blamed on sub-standard buildings thrown up by a construction industry rife with corruption.\"At the moment of the earthquake, coming from under ground, there's a sound, it's like a washing machine on a spin cycle,\" recalled grocer Gungor Dincer, who survived that quake.An earthquake in Istanbul in 1509, accompanied by floods and weeks of aftershocks, was so devastating it was described as the \"small doomsday\", opening fissures in the ground, bringing down the city walls and knocking over every minaret in the city, according to various accounts.The city of 13 million has been hit by quakes since then, but the epicentre has not been in Istanbul since 1894, or according to some experts 1766, when the quake was accompanied by a tsunami.\"NOT SCAREMONGERING\"\"We're not scaremongering,\" Kilic, deputy head of AKS told Reuters, saying people should be aware of the predictions. Some clearly are, as AKS has already sold 60 percent of a new development of quake-resistant steel-built houses due for handover this year.Concern has been mounting. A series of small earthquakes filled newspapers in recent weeks with expert predictions on when the next big one would come.In October local media quoted National Earthquake Council Chairman Haluk Eyidogan criticising authorities for failing to enforce rules on construction and structural inspections.Istanbul's governor acknowledged that many of the city's buildings would not withstand a large quake; professors at one leading university recently resolved to stop talking to the press to avoid stirring panic.But if the fear of a quake is proving good business for some, Istanbul's ability to protect the less wealthy is a political concern.An earthquake plan was launched after the 1999 quake near Istanbul, but experts say no action has been taken on the studies commissioned.One such study completed in 2004 shows that of 16,000 buildings in one vulnerable area 2,300 were declared very high risk -- or expected to collapse in a quake. Two similar studies are due to be completed in other areas next year.\"Nothing has been done yet,\" said Haluk Sucuoglu, professor of civil engineering and member of the National Earthquake Council.\"There's no political motivation related to this. They claim they are motivated but we don't see any action,\" he added.\"$10 BILLION, 10 YEARS\"Amid such criticism, Istanbul recently launched a major disaster simulation exercise to reassure the public.Istanbul municipality's director of soil and earthquake research, Mahmut Bas, told Reuters hospitals, schools and fire stations had been reinforced, houses built legally since 1999 met stricter rules, and the rescue operation had improved.Turkey in October 2005 signed a $400 million plan with the World Bank to improve its preparation for an emergency, strengthen facilities for earthquake resistance and ensure better enforcement of building codes.That sum compares with a terse estimate from Istanbul's Bas for preparing the city for a quake: \"$10 billion, 10 years.\"To invest that would be tricky in a heavily indebted European Union-applicant country where the International Monetary Fund keeps a close eye on spending.And in a city which receives tens of thousands of rural migrants a year, and where luxury malls coexist with shanty towns, upscale buildings like those Kilic sells can only be aimed at the minority.In Turkey, where the underground economy is huge, almost a third of the construction industry in unregistered, according to an estimate from the head of Turkey's Cement Producers' Association Adnan Ignebekcili.That leaves the rest in the city to weigh their options: refit buildings, pull them down, or trust to fate.Halim Sahin, an Istanbul real estate agent, said only 20 to 30 percent of his clients even ask about how safe a building would be in an earthquake.\"There's fatalism. People think you could die in a car crash, or of a heart attack ... As a society we're fatalists.\"(Additional reporting by Thomas Grove)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-turkey-earthquake-idUSL129987920070102", "sectors": [["World"]], "title": "quake - prone istanbul awaits disaster"},
{"date": "18:37 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Alabama For years, Al Rohling watched parents quit their jobs when their kids got sick, deliberately making their incomes drop to a point where they could get U.S. government medical help.Rohling, who directed Alabama's housing authority at the time, reached a startling conclusion: If children could drive parents into hardship when they became ill, could medical insurance help parents rediscover financial health?\"Health care for children really is a bridge to get out of poverty,\" said Rohling.Rohling quit his job in 1988 to help set up the Child Caring Foundation, which provides free health insurance for children through the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama health care provider.The foundation is just one example a charity that bridges the gap between Medicaid -- subsidized insurance -- for the poorest and private health insurance paid for either privately for those who can afford it or by an employer.That gap leaves up to 9 million U.S. children uninsured in the United States, a nation with no universal health care, and many parents are forced to struggle with a patchwork of other provisions in order to get health care for their children.\"The problem of the uninsured is getting worse,\" and the number of uninsured children has risen since 2004, said Jennifer Tolbert, principal analyst with the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, a Washington-based think tank.Tolbert said it was possible the U.S. Congress could increase the scope of the State Children's Health Insurance Progam (SCHIP) to provide greater state coverage for uninsured children when it debates reauthorizing the program next year.IN THE LURCHChildren with health insurance are usually taken to the doctor at the first sign of illness, while parents of uninsured kids often wait because they are conscious of the cost.Then the child's illness can worsen and the parent is forced to miss work to nurse the child back to health.In Alabama, there were 230,000 uninsured children in 1988, and that has fallen to around 70,000 due to a combination of the Child Caring Foundation and state programs.Jody Sharp, 60, is an example of the problem the charity aims to address.She and her husband adopted a foster child, Dana, from a mother who was mentally handicapped. Later, they adopted Dana's brother Kyle who has epilepsy and asthma.But Sharp's husband, the family wage earner, walked out in 1990, leaving Sharp to bring up the two children with no health insurance.\"If you never had a child with epilepsy, you would never know how many bills you can incur. With no insurance, it's thousands of dollars just like that,\" Sharp told Reuters.During their two years in the Alabama Blue Cross Blue Shield program, Sharp's children received free medical care and she found a job working with special needs children. The money saved helped her move into private health insurance.Some 90 percent of the 55,000 children on the program move into private health insurance within about 30 months.\"All of us have times when we lose jobs or lose our homes. You need the support of insurance so you don't have to worry about squeezing doctor bills out of an already stretched paycheck,\" said Sharp.BEAR'S EYETo recruit families, Rohling tours the state presenting health screenings at schools with the help of volunteers from the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Nursing and elsewhere.At one recent presentation, a student nurse pulled a teddy bear eye out of a child's ear, ending three years of one-sided deafness. It was an example of how problems can fester for children who don't have health insurance.Low cost health insurance for low income American children began in Pittsburgh in 1985 when Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Western Pennsylvania insured children of laid-off steel workers. By 2006, 144,000 children were in their program.\"There was a crisis. And the whole thing came about as an answer for how health insurance should work,\" said spokesperson Denise Grabner of Highmark.In 1997, the program expanded to include children of the working poor when Congress enacted the SCHIP providing some matching funding.Alabama was the first of 20 states to participate, creating the All Kids program, with money from state settlement with tobacco companies. The program provides insurance for children above the level at which they would qualify for Medicaid.Many states now provide insurance for families who earn up to double the poverty rate, defined as $10,000 a year for a single person and $20,000 for a family of four. But Rohling said an individual needed to earn nearly three times the poverty level to afford private insurance.\"We fill the void between affordability and eligibility.\"", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-usa-poverty-children-idUSN1940733220070102", "sectors": [["U.S., ", "Health"]], "title": "health insurance bridges gap for poor families"},
{"date": "17:31 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "MIAMI Estranged business partners of the \nSeminole Tribe of Florida claim in a lawsuit that the $965 \nmillion takeover of the Hard Rock Cafe International USA agreed \nlast month with Britain's Rank Group Plc (RNK.L) was rigged. The Cordish Co., a prominent Baltimore developer that \nhelped build the tribe's two Seminole Hard Rock casinos in \nFlorida, and an affiliate said in a lawsuit that the tribe and \nHard Rock had colluded to ensure the Seminoles won an auction \nfor the international chain of music-themed restaurants. The lawsuit filed on Friday in a Fort Lauderdale, Florida, \ncourt alleges that leaders of the Seminole's gambling business \nmet with Hard Rock executives to prepare offers months before \nRank last July announced it wanted to sell the Hard Rock Cafe \nInternational restaurants, hotels and entertainment venues. \"Defendants participated in collusion and bid rigging with \nrespect to offers to purchase Hard Rock from Rank,\" the lawsuit \nsaid. Lawyers for Cordish said their executives and bankers had \nbeen repeatedly refused offering documents for the auction and \nbeen barred from participating in the deal. The lawsuit also said Cordish had made an all-cash offer to \nRank for Hard Rock in 2005 and that the Hard Rock's managers \nhad been fearful of dismissal during any Cordish takeover. \nSenior managers will remain after the Seminole transaction. The lawsuit named as defendants Hard Rock Cafe \nInternational (USA) Inc., the unit's chief executive, Hamish \nDodds, and Seminole Hard Rock Entertainment Inc., and also \nasked for unspecified financial damages. A spokesman for the Seminole tribe in Hollywood, Florida, \nwas not immediately available to comment on the allegations and \nthe lawsuit. A spokesman for Hard Rock declined to comment. Rank's shareholders were expected to vote on Monday on the \nHard Rock deal, which will leave Rank as a pure gambling group \nand give the native American Seminoles an extensive, global \nplatform for adding casinos and hotels outside Florida. The Seminoles, who number about 3,300 and live in Florida \nreservations, said on December 7 in announcing the deal that \nthey had beat out 70 other bidders for the Hard Rock \nproperties. Some analysts criticized the $965 million (490 million \npound) purchase price as too low. Rank shares have fallen \nsharply since the Hard Rock deal was announced and now trade \naround 236 pence, in comparison to a year's high of 304 pence. Cordish and the Seminole Tribe are already locked in rival \nlawsuits arising from their partnership in the highly \nprofitable Seminole Hard Rock casinos opened in Florida's Tampa \nand Hollywood in 2004.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/businesspro-hardrock-seminole-dc-idUSN0233814920070102", "sectors": [["M&A, ", "Bonds"]], "title": "florida tribe sued over hard rock takeover"},
{"date": "18:27 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "NEW YORK Retired microbiologist Diana \nWestmoreland is no stranger to technology -- except when it \ncomes to computers. \"The programs are intimidating. The language that's used is \na foreign one to me,\" said Westmoreland, who lives near \nCardiff, Wales. \"I'm the sort of person who, when something \ncrashes, apologizes to the screen.\" The problem, says consultant David Platt, lies not with the \nuser but with the programmers, who just don't think like the \npeople who use their products. Platt is a computer science instructor at the Harvard \nUniversity Extension School and the author of a new book called \n\"Why Software Sucks ... And What You Can Do About It,\" \npublished by Pearson Plc (PSON.L) unit Pearson Education. One of his peeves is when a text-editing program like \nMicrosoft Word asks users if they want to save their work \nbefore they close their document. That question makes little sense to computer novices \naccustomed to working with typewriters or pen and paper, he \nsaid. For them, a clearer question would be: \"Throw away \neverything you've just done?\" Boxes that ask users to confirm whether they want to take a \nstep such as deleting a document are another example of what he \ncalls a bad feature. \"Your car does not ask, 'Do you really want to start the \nengine?' when you turn the key,\" Platt said. The confirmation box has become so overused that no one \npays any attention to it, even when it's warning about a \ndocument that should be kept, he said. Error messages represent software communication at its \nworst, Platt said. In his book, he recounts how after trying to \nsave a Web page from his Internet browser, he received a \nmessage that said it couldn't be done and gave him no other \nrecourse but to hit the OK button. \"No, it is not OK with me that this operation didn't work \nand the program can't explain why,\" he wrote.\n YOUR.USER.IS.NOT.YOU. Platt, who has also written nine books for computer \nprofessionals, has a message for software developers: \"Your. \nUser. Is. Not. You.\" People who write software programs value control. The user, \non the other hand, just wants something that's easy to operate. To illustrate his point, he notes that computer programmers \ntend to prefer manual transmissions. But not even 15 percent of \nthe cars sold in the United States last year had that feature. Similarly, many software programs come with functions -- \nlike the ability to move the menu bar -- that the average \nperson does not want or need. Programming instructions required \nfor such features, Platt said, \"increase the possibility of \ncrashing errors and security vulnerabilities in the same way as \nmore moving parts on any mechanical device render it less \nreliable.\" David Thomas, executive director of the Software & \nInformation Industry Association's software division, disputed \nPlatt's assessment of computer programmers. According to Thomas, the trouble with software programs is \nthat good ones often get overloaded with features demanded by \n\"power users,\" such as big corporations or vocal individuals. \"You don't want your customers to design your product,\" he \nsaid. \"They're really bad at it.\" As more and more software becomes Internet-based, he said, \ncompanies can more easily monitor their users' experiences and \nimprove their programs with frequent updates. They have a financial incentive to do so, since more \nconsumer traffic results in higher subscription or advertising \nrevenues. \"They know that if they don't make the customer experience \nenjoyable that the customer will stop using them,\" he said, \n\"whereas if I sell you a (software) product, I don't care if \nyou use it or not; I have your money.\" There is one area, however, where Thomas and Platt agree: \nthe Web still has a long way to go. Too many Web sites start off with home pages that offer \nanimation, music -- and no real information. \"Every time I want to look at an article and I have to \nclick to get past that multimedia thing, it drives me crazy,\" \nThomas said. \"They should be monitoring the fact that 99 \npercent of people try click on 'close' within a certain \nfraction of a second to get away from that thing.\" Web search company Google Inc. (GOOG.O) and photocopy chain \nFedex Kinko's, a unit of Fedex Corp. (FDX.N), provide \neasy-to-use Web sites, but others are still more complicated \nthan they need to be, Platt said. Starbucks Corp. (SBUX.O) incurred his wrath because the \ncoffee shop chain required him to specify a search radius when \nhe was trying to use its site find the nearest store. \"The Starbucks programmers probably think that having more \ncontrol over the search is powerful and cool,\" he wrote. \"But \nin reality it's a useless and annoying distraction. Nobody goes \naround asking, 'Is there a Starbucks within five miles? How \nabout 10? 15?\"' Platt said he voiced his sentiments to Starbucks, but \nreceived only an automated response. The company did not \ncomment for this article. While companies may not always reply, Platt urges his \nreaders to let them know about software problems by posting \nfeedback on their Web sites. \"The best companies want to hear \nfrom users,\" he said. He also advises consumers to check out what trustworthy \nsoftware reviewers have to say about a product before they buy \nit and to post their own comments on Web sites that sell the \nprograms. However, individuals can only do so much, and he is working \non forming an organization called \"It Just Works\" \n(suckbusters.com) to laud the good programs and ridicule \nthe bad. While Platt believes market forces are moving the software \nindustry in the right direction, he already is thinking about \nwriting a sequel called \"Why Software Still Sucks.\" \"I'd be astounded,\" he said in an e-mail, \"if (the \nindustry) made so much progress in the next year or two that it \nmight not benefit from another nudge.\"", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/businesspro-software-platt-dc-idUSN2227096620070102", "sectors": [["Tech"]], "title": "programmers to blame for hard - to - use software"},

But the measure passed a second vote by the same 61-132 margin.If it clears another legislative test expected by early next year, Massachusetts residents will vote on it in 2008.\"If it goes to the ballot, it would be a disaster for this state,\" said Arline Isaacson, co-chair of the Massachusetts Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus. \"The state will endure one of the nastiest and most divisive debates you've ever seen with the radical right money pouring in and an anti-gay campaign of the likes people could not possibly imagine.\"Although a majority in the Democratic-controlled state legislature voted against it, the measure needed only 50 votes to pass. It also was backed by 170,000 Massachusetts voters who signed a petition along with social conservatives including Republican Gov. Mitt Romney, a probable White House contender.Gay marriage advocates, including Democratic Gov.-elect Deval Patrick, had lobbied to kill the proposed amendment by pressing the state constitutional convention to recess without voting on the proposal.ANGERING ROMNEYThat is what happened on November 9 when lawmakers threw their support behind gay-marriage advocates by adjourning the constitutional convention without moving on the issue, angering Romney, who then asked the state's highest court to intervene.The Supreme Judicial Court ruled last week that it could not force lawmakers to vote but urged them to do so anyway, saying they had a constitutional duty to vote. That statement appeared to sway legislative leaders.The proposed amendment, which would define marriage as between a man and a woman, now goes to a second legislative vote expected by early 2008. If it clears that hurdle, it will be added to a ballot next year for a popular vote.\"I believe a vote to advance this question to the 2008 ballot is irresponsible and wrong,\" Patrick, who will be sworn in this week, said in a statement before the vote. \"It would do nothing more than condemn us all to more years of debate and expense on a matter that is legally and practically settled.\"In 2003, the state Supreme Judicial Court ruled that a ban on gay marriage was unconstitutional, leading to America's first same-sex marriages the following year. More than 8,000 gay and lesbian couples have since married.The debate in Massachusetts comes about two weeks after New Jersey became the third U.S. state to provide equal rights for same-sex couples in committed relationships known as civil unions.Marriage between same-sex couples is legal in Belgium, Canada, the Netherlands, Spain and South Africa.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/us-gay-marriage-massachusetts-idUSN0234041720070102", "sectors": [["U.S., ", "Politics"]], "title": "massachusetts lawmakers approve gay marriage vote"},

One of the fall's better sitcoms, \"The Class\" is about \nformer classmates who reunite after not seeing each other for \nyears. They've had varying degrees of success but never quite \nmeasured up to the promise of their school years. At the center \nof the group is a genuinely nice guy who's been dumped by his \ngirl. Another classmate is on the verge of suicide. \"Emergency\" has enough similarities -- right down to the \ndumped guy and the near-suicide -- that it could be a response \nto the same classroom assignment. The similarity of the two \npremises makes comparison inevitable which is too bad because \n\"Emergency,\" especially the pilot episode, is a solid sitcom \nwith a strong cast and a lot of potential. There's room for improvement, of course. Jonathan \nSilverman, who plays jilted greeting card writer and all-around \nnice guy Harry Kennison, needs to take his performance down a \nnotch or two. Also, there's no clear need for Dr. Joanna, the \ncharacter played by Lori Loughlin. She catches the eye of Jason \nVentress (David Arquette) after she patches him up following \nthe suicide scene but the relationship is forced and awkward, a \nspeed bump in an otherwise smooth and well-paced show. The others in the ensemble are Kelly Lee (Kelly Hu), the \nclass valedictorian who ended up providing sensual Korean \nmassages, and Sherman Yablonsky (Greg Germann), who shed his \nhigh school girth and became the author of a bestselling diet \nbook. When Sherman's wife splits unexpectedly, the shock sends \nhim back to binge eating. The show operates at a frantic pace -- sometimes too \nfrantic -- but it has its funny moments as well. Hu is adept at \nphysical comedy and \"Ally McBeal\" alumnus Germann makes his \npathetic character oddly appealing.

(F.N) to\nthe No. 2  spot in the U.S. auto market in December for the\nthird time in 2006, analysts said. Automakers release their December sales results on\nWednesday. Toyota, which is expected again to grow faster than all the\nother automakers, passed Ford in U.S. sales for the first time\nin July and again in November. Most analysts expect Ford sales to slip between 13 percent\nand 17 percent in December. \"The decrease is mostly a result of tough year end\ncompetition coupled with a weak product cadence,\" Merrill Lynch\nanalyst John Murphy said in a note to investors on Friday.\nMurphy estimates Ford will lose 1.2 percentage points of market\nshare in 2006. Calyon Securities analyst Joseph Amaturo said on Friday\nthat Ford's December sales would drop in part because it\nstopped producing the Taurus sedan, once the top-selling car in\nthe United States. Also, truck sales will likely decline during the month,\nhitting Ford hard because its F-Series trucks are the top-\nselling vehicles in that segment, analysts said. General Motors Corp. (GM.N) sales are expected to be down\nas much as 2 percent in December, while sales for\nDaimlerChrysler AG's DCXGn.DE Chrysler unit are expected to\nfall about 2 percent, according to analysts. \"The reason for the softness we are seeing is that October\nand November comps were so easy because of the pull-ahead\ncreated by summer discounts,\" IRN Inc. analyst Erich Merkle\nsaid last week. \"But December last year started a recovery. Next year,\ncomps are going to get much more difficult. You are going to\nsee some pretty dramatic declines on a percentage basis.\" The combined monthly U.S. market share for Detroit's Big\nThree is estimated to be 54.3 percent in December, down from\n56.6 percent a year earlier and up slightly from 53.2 percent\nlast month, according to Edmunds.com, which tracks the\nindustry. New U.S vehicle sales for December are expected to be a\nseasonally adjusted annual rate of between 16.5 million and\n16.8 million vehicles, according to analysts. That would be\ndown from last December's 17.1 million vehicle rate and an\nincrease from the 16 million rate posted in November. Both GM and Ford have launched year-end incentives to boost\nsales. Both programs, which run through Jan. 2, offer cash\nincentives. Ford's program also includes interest-free\nfinancing for up to 60 months on some 2006 vehicles. WINNERS OF '06 Toyota is the big winner in 2006 with sales up 12.5 percent\nthrough November. Analysts expect the Japanese automaker to be\nup about 12 percent in December. \"Toyota should be the strongest foreign (automaker) in\nDecember, as its year-over-year sales should benefit from its\npopular, fuel-efficient small and mid-sized passenger cars as\nwell as its typical year-end sales event,\" Calyon's Amaturo\nsaid. Asian automakers gained in 2006 because customers preferred\nsmaller SUVs and cars over larger gas-guzzling sport utility\nvehicles, partly due to high gasoline prices. Toyota, Nissan Motor Co. Ltd.  (7201.T), Honda Motor Co.\nLtd. (7267.T) and Hyundai Motor Co. Ltd. 005380.K have a\nstrong car line-up. U.S. automakers, on the other hand, have\nrelied to a greater extent on the large SUVs.\n  (Additional reporting by Jui Chakravorty)\n\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/auto-sales-us-idUSN0233975820070102", "sectors": [], "title": "toyota seen outpacing ford in u . s . december sales"},
{"date": "19:22 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "PHILADELPHIA New Jersey's death penalty should be abolished because it fails to deter murderers, burdens the state financially and is inconsistent with evolving standards of decency, a legislative panel said on Tuesday.The New Jersey Death Penalty Study Commission, set up last year by state lawmakers to assess if capital punishment should be kept, argued the death penalty should be replaced with life imprisonment in a maximum-security jail without parole.The 13-person panel -- representing police, prosecutors, public defenders, the judiciary and families of murder victims -- found the death penalty does not achieve its goal of deterring the worst murders, and that the legal costs of it outweigh those of keeping a criminal in prison for life.New Jersey, where nine people are currently on death row, conducted its last execution in 1963 and then suspended its death penalty because of uncertainty about the views of the U.S. Supreme Court, which reinstated capital punishment in 1976. New Jersey's current death penalty law dates from 1982.Thirty-eight of the United States' 50 states have the death penalty -- all use lethal injection except Nebraska which uses the electric chair.But Florida suspended its death penalty in December after a botched lethal injection led to a man taking 34 minutes to die, while in California last month a federal judge said the state's lethal injection methods caused an \"undue risk\" of pain \"so extreme\" that it may violate a constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment.Making life imprisonment the ultimate penalty in New Jersey would ensure public safety and the rights of murder victims' families, while removing the risk of executing someone in error, the 133-page report said.\"The penological interest in executing a small number of persons guilty of murder is not sufficiently compelling to justify the risk of making an irreversible mistake,\" the report said.It recommended that any cost savings from abolishing the death penalty should be used to provide benefits and services for the families of murder victims.Reed Gusciora, a Democratic assemblyman, welcomed the commission's \"well reasoned\" recommendations and said there is a \"very good\" chance they will become law in the Democrat-controlled legislature.Democratic Gov. Jon Corzine said in a statement that as an opponent of the death penalty, he looked forward to working with the legislature to implement the panel's recommendations.But Republican Assemblyman Guy Gregg said he was \"surprised and shocked\" at the commission's \"arbitrary opinion\" against a penalty that he argued should be allowed to continue for the worst crimes. Gregg noted that voters approved a constitutional amendment in favor of capital punishment in 1992.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-death-penalty-newjersey-idUSN0240204620070103", "sectors": [["U.S., ", "Politics"]], "title": "new jersey panel urges abolition of death penalty"},

Stamp duties have been rationalized and reduced, and a policy to set up special economic zones is boosting industrial growth.Nascent chains such as Pantaloon Retail (India) Ltd. and Reliance Retail Ltd. have lined up multi-billion dollar expansion plans in which the largest component has been set aside for leasing or buying organized retail space.In addition, companies such as Nike Inc. and Adidas are deepening their presence through franchised operations beyond India's metros to soak up demand from millions in the growing middle class.\"The demand for retail space across India will increase,\" said Vivek Dahiya, associate director at global property advisor DTZ India. \"Certain markets seeing oversupply will see reduction in vacancies.\"In Delhi, Gurgaon and Noida alone organized retail space is likely to rise to 14 million sq.ft. by the end of 2007 from 2 million now, he said.But the sharp rise in commercial rentals in the past three years is hurting growth prospects of organized retail chains, which operate on margins as low as 3-4 percent.\"Rentals are now dramatically higher - by at least 50 percent in a lot of cities,\" said Kishore Biyani, managing director at Pantaloon. \"At these prices we can't sign up new properties.\"Biyani, who started retailing in 1997, said annual sales needed to be at least 50 percent higher to offset rising rentals.In central parts of heavily congested Mumbai city, monthly rentals for discount stores have soared in excess of 125 rupees sq.ft from 55 rupees sq.ft about 2 years ago, said Pranay Vakil, chairman at Knight Frank India.\"This is madness and has little relevance to actual supply and demand factors,\" Vakil said. \"Rentals are now crossing the industry norm of 12 percent of gross sales, making it extremely difficult and unaffordable for retailers.\"But even after this rise, monthly retail rentals in prime commercial space or \"high street\" in Mumbai are low at $11 per sq.ft compared with $24 in Singapore and $80 in Hong Kong, according to data from Knight Frank India.SERVICES SECTORResearch firm SSKI forecasts demand for 160 million sq.ft. of commercial real estate over the next 3-4 years, driven primarily by the services sector, which contributes nearly 55 percent of GDP in Asia's fourth-largest economy.Similarly, the housing sector is likely to see 15.9 billion sq. ft. of construction by 2010, SSKI said in a recent report.However risks abound despite runaway gains and could harm short-term demand for residential property.\"The sharp run in property prices over the last 2-3 years and an upturn in the interest rate cycle are the key risks,\" said Shirish Rane, an analyst at SSKI.\"Commercial and retail properties are threatened by the trend of rising rentals which impact profitability.\"Prices of prime residential property in central Delhi have soared more than 75 percent over the past two years thanks to demand from a growing tribe of millionaires and a law that limits the number of floors that can be constructed.All this euphoria has also spilled onto the stock markets where the real estate stocks have been among the top performers thanks to scarce supply of quality paper.Initial public offerings of firms such as Parsvnath Developers Ltd. have seen huge demand and the stock listed, in November, at an 83 percent premium to the issue price of 300 rupees.($1 = 44.61 rupees)(Additional reporting by Nitin Luthra)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-india-property-idUSDEL30582720070103", "sectors": [], "title": "india ' s property boom yields high returns"},

New York-based Harbinger, which owns a 9.7 percent stake in\nRyerson, launched its proxy campaign several weeks after\ndisclosing it was considering \"a range of actions\" to pressure\nRyerson to improve its performance. \"The current board has not fulfilled its responsibility to\nenhance value for shareholders,\" Harbinger said in a statement.\nIt said Ryerson has \"consistently underperformed its industry\npeers on a variety of key performance metrics, including gross,\noperating and net margins and that peer companies have\nconsistently turned inventory more rapidly than Ryerson.\" Ryerson said it had received notice from Harbinger of the\nfund's proxy campaign and forwarded it to its board for\nreview. In early November, Ryerson reported third-quarter profit\nfell to $21.6 million, or 77 cents a share, from $30.7 million,\nor $1.18 a share, a year earlier. The 2005 quarter included\ngains totaling 72 cents a share. Ryerson's shares closed down 30 cents, or 1.2 percent, at\n$25.09 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares\nhave traded in a range between $19.60 and $33.20 over the last\n52 weeks. Harbinger operates two hedge funds, one with a strategy\nthat seeks to benefit from corporate restructurings and\nanother that takes positions in distressed company debt. The hedge fund group said it will file notification this\nweek with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of plans\nfor the proxy campaign. It said it would also introduce a\nshareholder proposal to \"deter\" the current board from\ninstituting \"obstacles\" to electing the Harbinger nominees. It didn't specify what issues it was concerned about, but\nsome common defenses to dissident shareholder proposals include\nexpanding a board or instituting a \"staggered board\" provision\nto prevent the election of a whole new board in any one year. Harbinger said Ryerson has been pursing the right strategy\nin cutting costs and improving productivity. But current\nmanagement has \"failed to execute on this strategy and requires\nbetter counsel.\" Harbinger will seek election of the following individuals\nto the Ryerson board: Keith Butler, owner of BCS Placements\nLLC, a broker dealer; Eugene Davis, chairman of Atlas Air\nWorldwide Holdings Inc.; Daniel Dienst, chairman of Metal\nManagement Inc.; Richard Kochersperger, director of Food\nMarketing Group; Larry Liebovich, retired former president of\nLiebovich Steel & Aluminum Co.; Gerald Morris, chief executive\nof Intalite International NV, a diversified holding company;\nand Allen Ritchie, a private investor.
