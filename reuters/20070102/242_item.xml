Corp. (SE.N) SE_w.N said on Tuesday it has completed its 
spinoff from power company Duke Energy Corp. (DUK.N). Martha Wyrsch, chief executive of Spectra's transmission 
unit, told Reuters that that as a stand-alone, publicly traded 
company, Spectra will have greater focus and a "direct line of 
sight" on its stock movement. Wyrsch said Spectra will look at possible acquisitions, 
particularly in transmission and storage space in North 
America. Spectra would also be interested in expanding its 
presence in the Northeastern and Southeastern United States, 
British Columbia and the Rockies, Wyrsch added. Spectra will start with a debt to total capitalization 
ratio of about 55 percent. Over the next three years, the 
company will consider debt to finance growth and expansion, 
Wyrsch said. Spectra previously announced it expected a cash shortfall 
of $800 million in 2007. Wyrsch said Spectra plans to raise $300 million to $500 
million from a pipeline master limited partnership and expects 
to close the transaction around mid-year. Going forward, Wyrsch said the company will utilize the 
master limited partnership as a financing tool and may place 
other company assets into the partnership if needed. Spectra shares will begin trading Wednesday on the New York 
Stock Exchange. Based in Houston, Spectra operates about 17,500 miles of 
transmission pipelines and 250 billion cubic feet of storage in 
the United States and Canada.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/02/businesspro-spectraenergy-spinoff-dc-idUSN0234024620070102</link><sectors><value><value>M&amp;A</value></value></sectors><title>spectra energy completes spinoff from duke energy</title></story></items>
