Alcatel-Lucent ALU.PA said on Tuesday it had completed its
acquisition of the high-speed UMTS mobile access business from
Canada's Nortel NT.TO NT.N for $320 million. The acquisition was made to help Alcatel-Lucent achieve
greater scale and push into tough markets such as China. After the deal, Alcatel-Lucent said one in four UMTS
operators, or about 40 customers worldwide, would use the
combined group's UMTS products. Nortel said in September it had decided to sell its
high-speed mobile operations to Alcatel because it was losing
money and had little prospect of a near-term turnaround. "The pre-integration work has progressed well," Mary Chan,
head of Alcatel-Lucent's wireless activities said in a
statement. "Our aim is to achieve the optimum combination of
Alcatel-Lucent and Nortel's technologies, with minimum customer
disruption," Chan added. "We are well positioned to capture the
UMTS market growth opportunity."
