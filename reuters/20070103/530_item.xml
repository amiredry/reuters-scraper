Administration has warned medical device maker Viasys
Healthcare Inc. VAS.N over its failure to implement certain
review procedures for its air pressure devices used to improve
breathing, according to a letter released on Wednesday. The agency had earlier warned the company about its lack of
procedures to review the devices, made by the company's Tiara
Medical Systems unit, the Dec. 12 letter said. Tiara Medical Systems, which Viasys said it acquired in
July 2006, makes products to treat sleep disorders and chronic
respiratory diseases. An FDA review of Tiara's Lakewood, Ohio, facility in
October and November 2006 found the company had not established
various procedures, including those to handle product
complaints and design validation, the agency said. Viasys later responded to the FDA on Nov. 14. Although the
FDA said the company's response to some of the issues appeared
to be adequate, it still had some concerns, according to the
the December letter. In the December letter, which was released on Wednesday,
the FDA said it will conduct a follow-up inspection. It also
gave the company 15 working days to respond, adding that any
other pending approvals for devices related to the review
procedures would be delayed until the problems were fixed. The letter was posted to the agency's Web site here Representatives for Viasys could not be immediately reached
for comment. Shares of Viasys closed down 22 cents to $27.60 on the the
New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.
