AMR.N up nearly 9 percent, as investors entered a new year expecting cheaper fuel and higher fares.AMR shares were up 8.8 percent at $32.88 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading. The Amex airline index .XAL was up 3.6 percent.Continental Airlines (CAL.N) rose 5.8 percent to $43.65 on the NYSE, while US Airways Group LCC.N gained 3.8 percent to $55.90. United Airlines parent UAL Corp. UAUA.O was up 4.6 percent at $46.02 on Nasdaq."I think they're just up because people are looking ahead, and most people think that 2007 will be better because of high price points and lower oil prices," said Benchmark Co. analyst Helane Becker.The airline industry has been battered in recent years by soaring fuel prices -- directly linked to the price of oil -- and low-fare competition.The price of NYMEX crude oil futures CLc1 fell 3.8 percent to $58.72 a barrel on Wednesday. Meanwhile, a trend toward higher fares continued, with major carriers matching a fare hike last week by Southwest Airlines (LUV.N).Another analyst, Jamie Baker at JP Morgan, noted in a research letter that Continental had estimated stronger-than-expected revenue for December. Continental is the only major carrier to report monthly revenue estimates, and the data often move share prices throughout the airline industry.Continental estimated that passenger revenue increased 5.5 percent to 6.5 percent.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-airlines-shares-amr-idUSN0323270520070103</link><sectors><value><value>Asian Markets</value></value></sectors><title>u . s . airline stocks up on fuel , improved ' 07 outlook</title></story></items>
