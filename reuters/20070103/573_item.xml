For now there are no plans to reenter the Peruvian market," he said.Illegal copies of DVDs with Hollywood blockbusters can be bought for around $1 from street vendors in downtown Lima, while it often costs twice as much to rent a licensed copy.There were a dozen Blockbuster franchise rental outlets, operated by Video International Peru, in the country two years ago. Local daily newspaper El Comercio said Video International Peru officials last year blamed piracy for slumping revenues of the franchise.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-blockbuster-piracy-idUSN0341210720070103</link><sectors><value><value>Tech</value></value></sectors><title>blockbuster shuts down in peru , piracy blamed</title></story></items>
