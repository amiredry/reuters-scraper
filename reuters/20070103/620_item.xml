negotiations to make his feature directing debut on the comedy 
"Outsourced." The story is set in motion after an American factory is 
shut down and transported to Mexico. Two workers venture south 
of the border to get their jobs back. Columbia Pictures 
originally envisaged it as a vehicle for Vince Vaughn and Owen 
Wilson. Currently, no cast is attached. Azaria, who voices the characters of Moe, Apu and Chief 
Wiggum on "The Simpsons," directed the 2004 short "Nobody's 
Perfect," an ensemble comedy featuring Ellen Pompeo, Maria 
Bello, Sarah Silverman and himself. He is coming off his Tony-nominated Broadway-run of 
"Spamalot" and the Emmy-winning television show "Huff," and 
will lend his voice to Fox's upcoming summer tentpole "The 
Simpsons Movie." His recent acting credits include "Along Came 
Polly" and "Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story." Reuters/Hollywood Reporter</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/04/film-azaria-dc-idUSN0326244520070104</link><sectors><value><value>Film</value></value></sectors><title>azaria ' s job outsourced for comedy</title></story></items>
