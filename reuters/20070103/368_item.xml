Wednesday, with American Airlines parent AMR Corp. AMR.N up
nearly 9 percent, as investors entered a new year expecting
cheaper fuel and higher fares. AMR shares were up 8.8 percent at $32.88 in afternoon New
York Stock Exchange trading. The Amex airline index .XAL was
up 3.6 percent. Continental Airlines (CAL.N) rose 5.8 percent to $43.65 on
the NYSE, while US Airways Group LCC.N gained 3.8 percent to
$55.90. United Airlines parent UAL Corp. UAUA.O was up 4.6
percent at $46.02 on Nasdaq. "I think they're just up because people are looking ahead,
and most people think that 2007 will be better because of high
price points and lower oil prices," said Benchmark Co. analyst
Helane Becker. The airline industry has been battered in recent years by
soaring fuel prices -- directly linked to the price of oil --
and low-fare competition. The price of NYMEX crude oil futures CLc1 fell 3.8
percent to $58.72 a barrel on Wednesday. Meanwhile, a trend
toward higher fares continued, with major carriers matching a
fare hike last week by Southwest Airlines (LUV.N). Another analyst, Jamie Baker at JP Morgan, noted in a
research letter that Continental had estimated
stronger-than-expected revenue for December. Continental is the
only major carrier to report monthly revenue estimates, and the
data often move share prices throughout the airline industry. Continental estimated that passenger revenue increased 5.5
percent to 6.5 percent.
