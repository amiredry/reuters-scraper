adds new paragraph 8 and latest Nasdaq volume) By Emily ChasanNEW YORK Jan 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended little
changed in their 2007 debut session  on Wednesday, as minutes
from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting renewed concerns
about the strength of the economy and corporate profits and
halted an early rally. A drop in oil prices and news of the resignation of the
embattled chief executive of Home Depot Inc. (HD.N)  had
pushed the Dow to an intraday record high in early trading. Energy stocks suffered their biggest one-day fall in over
a year as oil prices tumbled more than 4 percent. But positive
analyst comments prompted a gain in the shares of Web search
leader Google Inc. (GOOG.O), which helped support the Nasdaq. The market turned lower, bringing the Dow back down from a
more than 100-point rise, after minutes from the Fed's
December meeting showed some Fed officials felt risks to
economic growth had increased and one member thought monetary
policy could be adjusted in either direction. For details, see
[ID:nN03408654]"Traders questioned both growth in the U.S. economy and
whether the Fed is indeed done raising interest rates," said
Tim Biggam, options strategist at Man Securities, an options
brokerage firm in Chicago. "The day started out bad for oil
and other commodity-related stocks." The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 11.37 points,
or 0.09 percent, to end at 12,474.52. The Standard &amp; Poor's
500 Index .SPX slipped 1.67 points, or 0.12 percent, to
finish at 1,416.63. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC
advanced 7.87 points, or 0.33 percent, to close at 2,423.16. Earlier in the session, the Dow hit an all-time high of
12,580.35. Investors returned to the market after four days off,
which helped boost trading volume. The U.S. stock market was
closed on Monday for New Year's Day and on Tuesday for a
national day of mourning for former President Gerald Ford, who
died last week. CHEAPER OIL HELPS - AND HURTS Shares of Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) were the heaviest
weight on both the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 as mild weather in the
U.S. Northeast cut demand for heating oil and prompted a drop
in crude prices. Exxon Mobil's stock lost 3.3 percent, or
$2.52, to $74.11 on the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. crude oil for February delivery CLc1 fell $2.73, or
4.5 percent, to settle at $58.32 a barrel. The CBOE oil index .OIX of energy company stocks lost
3.3 percent -- its biggest one-day drop since December 2005. However, sliding oil prices also sparked optimism that
high energy costs would not weigh down corporate profits. "The decline in oil has helped transportation stocks,
which have lagged the market badly for the last few months,"
said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at New York
brokerage Spencer Clarke. The Dow Jones Transportation Average .DJT finished up
almost 2 percent. HOME DEPOT AND WAL-MART CLIMB Helping the Dow, shares of Home Depot Inc. (HD.N) gained
2.3 percent after the big U.S. home improvement retailer's
Chief Executive Robert Nardelli abruptly left in a mutual
decision with its board of directors.For details, see
[ID:nN03383942] Last year, Nardelli came under fire over a pay
package. Home Depot shares shot up 91 cents to $41.07 on the NYSE
and ranked second among the Dow's biggest gainers. Shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT.N) climbed 3 percent,
or $1.37, to $47.55 after the world's largest retailer
estimated over the weekend that December same-store sales rose
more than expected in the crucial holiday shopping period.
[ID:nN30286457] On the Nasdaq, shares of Google Inc. (GOOG.O) rose 1.5
percent, or $7.11, to $467.59. Analysts at Piper Jaffray
raised their price target on Google to $630 from $600, while
Stifel Nicolaus said Google has replaced eBay Inc. (EBAY.O) on
its select list. [ID:nBNG172155] [ID:nN03415698] General Motors Corp. (GM.N) was another weight on the
market, falling 4.1 percent, or $1.27, to $29.45 on the NYSE,
after the company said its U.S. December sales fell nearly 10
percent and that it would cut its first-quarter production.
[ID:nN03419522] GM was the Dow's second-biggest loser.Trading volume was heavy on the New York Stock Exchange,
with about 2.07 billion shares changing hands. On the Nasdaq,
about 2.53 billion shares were traded. Advancing shares outnumbered decliners by a ratio of about
9 to 8 on the NYSE and about 16 to 15 on the Nasdaq.
