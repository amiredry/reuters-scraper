their management and give investors more information, the
Financial Times reported.

Henry Kravis, who heads U.S. buy-out firm Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co, told the Wall Street Journal. He said there were
"staggering amounts" of derivatives used as a source of
investment capital. "If there are difficulties and
counterparties start to default, that could pose problems for
private equity," he said. **  Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) and Bank of China
(3988.HK) are likely to work together in the field of aircraft
leasing, the Daily Telegraph reported. RBS, which took a 5-percent stake in Bank of China in 2005,
has identified this area as a potential joint venture agreement
alongside credit cards and wealth management.

retailer, has filed a notice of "intention to go into
administration" at Manchester Crown Court, the Daily Telegraph
reported.

million pounds on bolstering its stake in one of China's leading

Brewery to just under 20 percent.
 ** Hutchison Telecommunications International Ltd. 2332.HK
and India's Essar group differ on their interpretation of a
first right of refusal clause in their Indian joint venture,

Essar, India's fourth-largest mobile service provider.

Sweden's Wallenberg family, has rejected a bid approach for lawn
mower and chain saw maker Husqvarna (HUSQb.ST), newspaper Dagens
Nyheter reported.
 ** British roadside restaurant chain Little Chef is set to
announce a last minute rescue deal with new investors as early

million pounds ($19.72 million) to acquire the motorway eating
stops, the Financial Times said.
