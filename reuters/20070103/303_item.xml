UniFirst Corp. (UNF.N) reported first-quarter earnings above
Wall Street estimates, driven by 10.5 percent revenue growth in
its core laundry business, sending its shares to a new year
high. The stock touched $43.95, topping the previous peak of
$41.63, which it had reached on Dec. 4, 2006. J.P. Morgan Securities, which has an "overweight" rating on
the stock, said it continues to expect strong earnings per
share growth from UniFirst in fiscal 2007 due in part to robust
internally generated growth and lower energy comparisons. It said in a research report that the stock is
"attractively valued", trading at 16.3 times its fiscal 2007
EPS estimate. The Wilmington, Mass.-based company said its specialty
garments segment posted a 28.1 percent rise in revenue in the
