Wednesday it is offering consumer incentives to lease certain
top-selling vehicles and interest-free loans on a few others to
boost sales momentum for the year. The deals, which run from Jan. 3 through Feb. 28, include
zero percent financing for five years on the Ford Escape and
Mercury Milan SUV. Ford is offering lease deals on the Fusion sedan for $249 a
month for 39 months with no down payment and no money due at
signing, the company said. The Milan sedan can be leased for $208 monthly with $1,999
due at signing, and the F-150 pickup truck can be leased
starting at $249 a month for 36 months with $1,999 due at
signing, Ford said in a statement. Ford's new incentives follow a year-end sales event that
expired on Tuesday. The company had offered cash rebates or
low-interest financing. Most of the new deals apply to 2007 model-year vehicles.
The automaker will report December and year-end sales later on
Wednesday.
