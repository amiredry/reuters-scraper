on Wednesday it received a milestone payment from its licensing
partner, ImClone Systems Inc. IMCL.O, after U.S. regulators
cleared the way for human trials of its experimental antibody
that targets platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha for
the treatment of cancer. Medarex said the Phase I clinical trial is currently under
way and expects to enroll 30 to 40 patients with solid tumors
at two clinical sites in the United States.
