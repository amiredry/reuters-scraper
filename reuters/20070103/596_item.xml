It also houses the state's only Death Row where the condemned are executed by lethal injection.A spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said although the closure was a first for the prison north of San Francisco, other state prisons have closed for several days at a time to prevent the spread of disease, most recently just a few weeks ago.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/04/us-prison-sanquentin-idUSN0344301320070104</link><sectors><value><value>U.S.</value></value></sectors><title>san quentin stops taking new inmates amid stomach bug</title></story></items>
