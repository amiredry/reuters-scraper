smoke and mirrors. When 2006 began, fearful studio executives 
were still reeling with the first down year in DVD history. 
They were anxiously looking for salvation, and hoping to find 
it in high-definition discs, digital downloads or perhaps a 
combination of the two. The next generation of software did launch in 2006, 
regrettably with two incompatible formats, first HD-DVD in 
April and then Blu-ray Disc in June. Digital downloading began 
as well, with all the big Hollywood studios aggressively 
selling their hot new movies on Movielink, CinemaNow, Apple's 
iTunes and other download services. Studio executives even 
coined a new term, "electronic sell-through," or EST, for the 
lucrative business model. But in the end, none of these technological marvels really 
mattered. High-def discs still are a blip on the sales radar, 
and digital downloading are even less of a blip. And lo and 
behold, what saved the day for home entertainment was an 
unexpected resurgence in the DVD market, fueled by a powerful 
slate of summer theatricals. "What we're looking at is a market that is up slightly from 
last year, overall," said David Bishop, president of Sony 
Pictures Home Entertainment. "But if you break down the 
components, we're projecting DVD sales to be up 3 percent, 
year-over-year, and rental to be up about 12 percent. What 
drags the industry down to a flat or slightly up basis is that 
VHS sales and rentals are virtually going away." "The industry is up as a whole, despite a decrease in 
overall pricing," added Kelley Avery, president of worldwide 
home entertainment at Paramount Pictures. "Contrary to popular 
belief, reports of the decline of DVD have been exaggerated." Much of the optimism floating around the studio DVD 
divisions stems from the exceptionally strong fourth quarter. 
Things got off to a good start when Fox's "X-Men: The Last 
Stand" and Disney's "The Little Mermaid Platinum Edition" 
generated $80 million in consumer spending in a single day. 
Further triumphs came as the quarter progressed, culminating 
this month when Disney's "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's 
Chest" sold 10.5 million DVDs its first week in stores, putting 
it on track to become the top-selling live-action DVD ever. The fourth-quarter DVD sales rally was probably the biggest 
home entertainment story of 2006, even though it didn't make 
the biggest headlines. That honor went to the launch of the two 
high-def disc formats and the flurry of major studio deals with 
digital downloading services. On the packaged-media front, the launch of two rival, 
incompatible formats was, if not a disaster, a major 
disappointment. But the real culprit, and the reason software 
sales have been anemic (fewer than 10,000 units of even a 
really big title are typical), wasn't so much a lack of a 
unified standard. It was the fact that consumer electronics 
manufacturers really dropped the ball, with a series of delays 
that really pinged adoption rates. The HD-DVD camp never got 
beyond two Toshiba models, including an entry-level model 
retailing for $499, while only at the very end of the year did 
Blu-ray get additional players to join the $999 Samsung model 
that arrived in stores in late June. "Everyone was disappointed in the quantity (of players) 
that came out of the electronics companies," said Warner Home 
Video president Ron Sanders. "But what is encouraging is that 
the attach rate of the software was amazingly high. On average, 
consumers bought 28 to 30 movies per set-top box, and that's 
just below what it was for DVD in the same time frame." Digital downloading, simmering on the back burner for 
several years, also had its official coming out in April when 
five of the six major studios begin selling downloads of their 
movies over the Internet, through services Movielink and 
CinemaNow. New releases went out day-and-date with the DVDs. 
Holdout Disney soon joined the party, and by year's end, the 
two dedicated download services were joined by a wide variety 
of others, including Apple's iTunes, Amazon.com and 
file-swapping service BitTorrent. The only hitch was that in 
most cases, downloaded movies could not be burned to standard 
DVDs for easy transport into the living room. In the retail world, the mass merchants continued to 
clobber each other over price and exclusive gifts with purchase 
on hot new theatrical DVD releases, while two veteran 
audio-video combo chains, Musicland and Tower Records and 
Video, bit the dust. The former was acquired by Trans World 
Entertainment after filing for bankruptcy, while Tower was 
liquidated. So what lies ahead for 2007? For starters, studio 
presidents expect big things from high-def discs. The prognosis 
for 2007 is that one of the two rival formats will fall by the 
wayside, consumer electronics makers will rally and start 
cranking out players, the Chinese will weigh in with cheap 
players of their own and by the fourth quarter, high-def discs 
will be a viable, significant business. "Consumers are buying more high-definition TVs than ever 
before," said Craig Kornblau, president of Universal Studios 
Home Entertainment. And once they get hooked on high-definition 
entertainment through digital cable, he said, consumers are 
going to want, even expect, high-def content from all their 
media, spurring demand for high-def discs. The digital download market, too, is expected to grow 
significantly, particularly with the prospect that consumers 
will be able to burn downloaded movies onto DVDs playable in 
their set-top units. CinemaNow introduced the download-to-burn 
option on select catalog titles during the summer, but this 
year the gates are expected to be thrust wide open. Depending on how well the summer theatrical features fare 
at the box office, studio chiefs say 2007 could be a very good 
year, overall, for home entertainment.
