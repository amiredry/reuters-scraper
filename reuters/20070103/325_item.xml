fund managers of Longleaf Partners, Oakmark Funds and the Trust
Company of the West (TCW) on Wednesday for its 2006 Fund
Manager of the Year awards. The awards, which are closely watched in the asset
management industry, recognize managers in three categories --
domestic stocks, international stocks and fixed income -- who
produce strong, long-term returns and adopt
shareholder-friendly practices. "Morningstar's three fund managers of the year stood above
the rest by adhering to disciplined strategies. They also put
their shareholders first by closing funds in a timely manner,
keeping fund costs down and communicating with their
shareholders in a straightforward fashion," the firm said. Mason Hawkins and Staley Cates, who run the Longleaf
Partners Fund and Longleaf Partners Small Cap fund, and David
Herro, who manages the Oakmark International and Oakmark
International Small Cap funds, were chosen for the award in the
stocks categories. Jeffrey Gundlach, who runs the TCW Total Return Bond fund,
was named the fixed income manager of the year.
