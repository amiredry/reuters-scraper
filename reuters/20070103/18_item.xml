on Wednesday let stand an earlier ruling that reinstated a
patent infringement case filed by a Schering AG SCHG.DE
affiliate against Tyco Healthcare.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit turned
down a request to review its previous decision from October,
without comment. In the earlier ruling, the appeals court reversed a
decision by a lower court judge who had thrown out the case
against Tyco Healthcare, a unit of Tyco International Ltd.
(TYC.N). The patent case was filed in 2001 by Medrad Inc., a
Schering affiliate based in Pennsylvania, and centers on an
infusion system used with magnetic resonance imaging. Tyco Healthcare issued a statement on Wednesday saying it
was disappointed in the denial. The company said that the
court's decision does not affect its "ability to supply patient
infusion systems that are used in magnetic resonance imaging
procedures." "We will continue to serve our customers as we vigorously
assert our defenses in this case," the company said in its
statement.
