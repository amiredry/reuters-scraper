were not impacted by the shutdown of a major crude oil pipeline
bringing oil in from Canada, company and fuel market sources
said on Wednesday. Enbridge Inc. (ENB.TO) shut the 300,000 barrel-per-day
pipeline Jan. 1 after it ruptured, spilling 29,000 gallons of
crude onto a Wisconsin farmer's field. Enbridge said it hopes
to restart the line later Wednesday or early Thursday. "There's been no impact to refining operations around
Chicago," a market source said. Chicago-area refineries include Exxon Mobil's (XOM.N) plant
in Joliet, Illinois, BP's (BP.L) plant in Whiting, Indiana, and
Citgo's plant in Lemont, Illinois. Sources with knowledge of Exxon's and BP's refineries said
they were running normally and had multiple sources of crude
oil to substitute for the lost Canadian grades. Officials at Exxon and BP declined comment. Cash fuel prices in the Chicago market were holding in
range, traders and brokers said. A Citgo official was not immediately available.
