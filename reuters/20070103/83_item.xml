Corp. SGP.N will develop and sell Denmark's ALK-Abello 
anti-allergy drug Grazax in North America, the Danish company 
said on Wednesday. Shares in the Danish company rose 7.1 percent to 1,550 
crowns on the news. The drug treats grass pollen, house dust mite and ragweed 
allergies. The two companies will develop and sell it in the 
United States, Canada and Mexico, with Schering-Plough 
acquiring exclusive license rights. Under the agreement, ALK-Abello will receive $35 million 
upfront from Schering-Plough and may receive a total of $255 
million in milestone payments. Out of this amount, $65 million 
relates to the clinical development and regulatory approval for 
the drug and the rest to sales goals. ALK-Abello will also receive royalty payments on net sales 
of the product in North America. Schering-Plough will be responsible for all the costs of 
clinical development, registration, marketing and sales of the 
drug in North America, while ALK-Abello will deal with 
production and supply. Schering-Plough shares last traded down 22 cents at $23.64
