Corp. (SONC.O) on Wednesday reported lower quarterly earnings 
due to higher interest expense and costs for paying down debt. Net income for the fiscal first quarter was $15.3 million, 
or 19 cents per share, compared with $16.4 million, or 18 cents 
per share, in the year-ago period. Wall Street analysts, on average, had been expecting 
earnings of 19 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. In November, Sonic said first-quarter earnings would be at 
the low end of its 19 cents to 20 cents per share estimate 
because of weaker-than-expected sales at franchised 
restaurants.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/04/businesspro-sonic-results-dc-idUSWEN172920070104</link><sectors><value><value>Markets</value></value></sectors><title>sonic 1st - quarter net earnings fall</title></story></items>
