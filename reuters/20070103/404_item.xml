December after a contraction in November, while construction
spending fell less than expected in November, according to data
on Wednesday suggesting a moderate economic expansion. However, the data was eclipsed by minutes from the Federal
Reserve's Dec. 12 policy meeting, which showed some members
were becoming a bit anxious about the economy and a separate report saying private-sector employment fell in December --
the first time in three years. The Fed minutes released on Wednesday said that while
inflation was the predominant concern, some members felt the
"subdued tone" of economic data meant risks to growth had
increased. "Several members judged that the subdued tone of some
incoming indicators meant that the downside risks to economic
growth in the near term had increased a little and become a bit
more broadly based than previously thought," said the minutes. Government bond prices edged higher, while the dollar
initially fell on the minutes. Stocks dipped after the minutes
were released. But analysts said little weight should be attached to the
minutes as they had been overtaken by recent data pointing to a
resilient economy. "This Fed meeting was held before the spate of reports,
starting with retail sales in the middle of December, that
showed the economy looking more resilient," said Cary Leahey,
managing director at Decision Economics in New York. Earlier, the Institute for Supply Management said its index
of national factory activity climbed to 51.4 from 49.5 in
November -- above the 50-threshold that separates growth from
contraction. Analysts had forecast a reading of 49.9. "That makes the general economy look steadier and even
firmer than it was thought to be," said Pierre Ellis, senior
economist at Decision Economics in New York. INFLATION PRESSURES MODERATING Analysts were also encouraged by the decline in the ISM's
prices paid index, which measures inflation pressures at the
industrial level. The index fell to 47.5 from 53.5, while a
measure of new orders climbed to 52.1 from 48.7. "The fact the price index is down is good news," said
Robert MacIntosh, chief economist at Eaton Vance Management in
Boston. However, for the Fed the overall index is "a small
piece of data but everything else being equal, this would make
them hold off from a cut." The data was seen as further confirmation that the Fed
would probably hold interest rates unchanged well into the
first half of 2007. The central bank raised its target for the federal funds
rate 17 times to 5.25 percent between June 2004 and June 2006.
Analysts expect it to start easing monetary policy sometime
this year. The next policy-setting meeting for the Fed is
scheduled for the end of the month. A major component of factory output appeared to stabilize
in December according to sales figures on Wednesday. Paul
Ballew, General Motor's chief sales analyst said the industry's
U.S. light vehicle sales in December ran at an annual adjusted
rate of 16.9 million, while sales for 2006 are estimated down
about 2.3 percent to 16.7 million. Construction spending also pointed to a resilient economy.
Spending fell 0.2 percent in November, led by an eighth
straight drop in private residential building that more than
offset record highs in nonresidential and public construction. HOUSING MARKET RESLIENT More current data showed some resilience in the U.S.
housing market. Mortgage applications rose last week, led by
demand for home purchase loans even as interest rates climbed
for a fourth consecutive week, an industry trade group said. The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally
adjusted index of mortgage application activity, which includes
both refinance and purchase loans, rose 3.6 percent last week. But analysts were cautious on the economy and pointed to a
report that showed U.S. private sector employment contracted in
December for the first time since April 2003. The monthly ADP National Employment Report showed private
sector employers shed 40,000 jobs after adding 158,000 jobs in
November. The report is based on payroll data and measures the
change in total private sector nonfarm employment each month. "The ADP number suggests we are only starting to feel the
impact of a slower economy," said Boris Schlossberg, senior
currency strategist at Forex Capital Markets in New York. The ADP report hinted the government's closely watched
nonfarm payrolls report for December, due on Friday, might
prove soft, although economists debate the extent of the
correlation between the two reports. "This is a big surprise. ... There is no evidence of
systematic problems in the ADP survey," said Ian Shepherdson,
chief U.S. economist at High Frequency economics in New York. He said his firm would cut its estimate for the Labor
Department's report to 75,000 jobs created, from an original
estimate of 100,000. "ADP is not perfect and is sometimes horribly wrong, but it
is the best of a bad bunch of payroll indicators and cannot be
completely ignored." According to the latest Reuters poll, Economists expect
Friday's report show 110,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added in
December, slowing from a 132,000 gain in November.
