It's really hard, really hard, but it is the right thing to do," said Mulally, who took the reins at Ford in September with a mandate to turn the struggling company around."The most important thing is to match the (production) capacity to the current demand, restructure to operate profitably," Mulally said at a media dinner, ahead of the Detroit auto show, at Ford's Dearborn design center.Ford's third turnaround plan in five years calls for the company to cut its work force by a third and close more than a dozen plants. It has also raised about $25 billion in cash through liens, bond offerings and credit lines."We clearly are at a turning point," said Mulally, who was hired from aircraft maker Boeing Co. "I feel more confident now than when I arrived that we can make a viable Ford."Mark Fields, Ford's president of the Americas, said Ford made a progress on its restructuring in 2006."Last year, despite the numbers, was a year of incremental progress for us," Fields said.The company is drawing up a short list of bidders for Aston Martin, its British premium brand."A decision will be made this year," Mulally said of the prospective sale.He also said the automaker continues to evaluate its brand portfolio and did not rule out eventually selling Ford's money-losing Jaguar luxury unit.Asked about his meeting in Tokyo last month with Toyota Motor Corp. Chairman Fujio Cho, Mulally said they discussed advanced technology and the regulatory environment among other things for about two hours, but declined to give details.Mulally said he admires the Japanese automaker for its manufacturing processes and product development strategy.Asked if Ford was considering any kind of partnership with the increasingly dominant Japanese automaker, Mulally said there were opportunities to cooperate in technology and on free trade agreements."We're always looking for opportunities to collaborate on all levels," he added.Industry analysts have speculated that Ford, which looks set to be overtaken this year by Toyota as the No. 2 seller of automobiles in the United States, may be interested in Toyota's fuel-efficient hybrid engine technology."I really want to connect with each of the manufacturers and want to do it quickly. Because we have so many things in common that we have to deal with," Mulally said.He said he has also met with other auto makers - including General Motors Corp. and DaimlerChrysler AG since taking over as CEO.Ford in December managed to retain its No.2 spot in the U.S. market. Toyota had overtaken Ford in July and November last year.Ford's overall U.S. sales, unadjusted for the number of selling days, slipped 13 percent in December and 8 percent for 2006, partly because of lower demand for its best-selling F-Series pickup trucks.Ford also lost $7 billion through September of last year with further losses forecast in the October-December quarter and beyond. By Ford's own estimate, its North American unit will lose money until 2009 and run through $17 billion cash in the next three years.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/04/us-ford-mulally-idUSN0341592820070104</link><sectors></sectors><title>ford ceo says restructuring going well</title></story></items>
