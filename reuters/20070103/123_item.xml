of IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE.N) with an "overweight"
rating and NYMEX Holdings Inc. NMX.N with an "underweight"
rating. The brokerage said it added ICE to its focus list and set a
price target of $178 on the stock. In a research note, the brokerage said it saw significant
futures contract volume growth potential for the energy
derivatives marketplace, and ICE's merger with the New York
Board of Trade should create meaningful synergies. On NYMEX, the brokerage said although trading fundamentals
are strong and cost-cutting potential significant, it finds
valuation stretched and advised investors to wait for a better
entry point.
