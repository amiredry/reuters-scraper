a new regulation adopted by the Spanish health ministry will
affect a major portion of the company's product sales in
Spain.
 The regulation, effective March 1, 2007, lowers the amount the
government will reimburse for several pharmaceutical products
sold in Spain, the company said in a statement. If the regulation had been in effect during 2006, revenue
would have been reduced by about 10 to 12 percent based on 2006
projected product mix and volumes, the company added.
