on Thursday, the first trading day of 2007, with Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203.T) rising on news that it became one of the Big Three
automakers in 2006 and other exporters advanced on a softer yen. Tokyo markets are open for a half day of business on Thursday
from 09:00-11:00 a.m. (0000 GMT-0200 GMT). They were closed
Monday through Wednesday for New Year's holidays. "The Nikkei is up following solid growth in U.S. and European
markets during our market holidays," said Tsuyoshi Segawa, an
equity strategist at Shinko Securities. "The fact that the yen has been getting softer since the end
of last year and that market participants tend to focus on
hopeful stocks for the year, Toyota and Nippon Steel for example,
is also helping the rise." The Nikkei was up 144.56 points at 17,370.39 as of 0107 GMT.
The broader TOPIX index .TOPX gained 1.18 percent to 1,700.90. Segawa said gains may be limited into next week, however, as
investors are concerned that stocks might have risen too far. Shares of Toyota rose 2 percent at 8,120 yen following data
showing its sales rose more than 16 percent in the United States
in December, ousting DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE to become one of
the Big Three automakers in 2006. Toyota's stock earlier hit a record high of 8,140 yen. Investors were also encouraged to buy Toyota and other
automakers with the dollar trading near a 12-week high versus the
yen. Honda Motor Co. (7267.T) gained 1.3 percent at 4,760 yen and
Nissan Motor Co. (7201.T) added 2.1 percent at 1,463 yen. A weaker yen is a boon to Japanese exporters as it boosts
profits when earnings from abroad are brought home. The U.S. dollar was trading at 119.27 against the yen JPY=
in early Asian trading. NTT DoCoMo Inc. was up 2.7 percent to 193,000 yen after the
Nikkei business daily said Japan's largest mobile operator will
keep initial investment on its so-called super 3G network down to
100-200 billion yen, which may enable DoCoMo to cut down fees and
help retain users. [ID:nT142263]
