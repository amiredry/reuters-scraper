up the pilot "Mary Sunshine" to series, ordering 11 additional 
episodes of the light drama starring Mary McCormack. The project, previously known as "In Plain Sight," centers 
on a U.S. Marshal who tries to balance her intense job at the 
witness-protection program with her equally intense and 
amusingly dysfunctional personal life. To accommodate McCormack's pregnancy, production on the 
series is slated to begin in the summer for a launch in the 
fourth quarter or first-quarter 2008. "When you've got something so good, you don't let it go," 
said Jeff Wachtel, USA executive vp original programming. Following USA's success with such male-centered 
character-based series as "The Dead Zone," "Monk" and "Psych," 
the network brass had been looking for a show with a female 
lead. "We liked that ('Mary's') a woman in a high-risk job, which 
brings a real action component to it," Wachtel said. "And we 
liked the irony that she has that high-risk job but can't tell 
anybody what she's doing." "Mary," which co-stars Lesley Ann Warren, Frederick Weller, 
Todd Williams and Nichole Hiltz, is one of three pilots USA 
ordered last year. The other two, "To Love and Die in L.A." and 
"Burn Notice," are still "in active contention," Wachtel said. McCormack's credits include "The West Wing" and "ER." She 
also played Howard Stern's wife in "Private Parts."
