rose on Wednesday after minutes from the Dec. 12 Federal
Reserve policy-setting meeting said the subdued tone of
economic data showed that downside risk to economic growth had
increased. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR rose 3/32 in price for
a yield of 4.67 percent, compared with 4.68 percent just before
the minutes were released and 4.68 percent late on Tuesday.
Bond yields and prices move inversely.
