Wednesday AvalonBay Communities Inc. (AVB.N) will replace
Symbol Technologies Inc. SBL.N in its flagship Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 stock index .SPX after the close of trading on a
date to be announced. AvalonBay, based in Alexandria, Virginia, is a real estate
investment trust specializing in upscale apartment complexes.
Symbol, a maker of bar code and inventory scanning technology,
agreed last September to be acquired by cell phone maker
Motorola Inc. MOT.N for about $3.9 billion. Shares of companies entering the S&amp;P 500 often rise because
many portfolio managers try to track the index, and are
required to buy its component stocks. AvalonBay shares rose
$2.30, or 2.1 percent, to $131.05 in after-hours electronic
trading following S&amp;P's announcement. They had fallen $1.30
during regular Wednesday trading.
