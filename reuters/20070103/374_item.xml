Days later, the government lost a general election and the new Socialist administration pulled its troops out of Iraq.In February, a Spanish court is due to start the trial of 29 people for their part in the train bombings, most of them Spaniards and Moroccans.Investigators are still looking for other suspects thought to have fled Spain after the bombs, including Mohamed Afalah, Mohamed Belhadj and Daoud Ouhnane.Spanish authorities believe Afalah died in a suicide attack in Iraq in May 2005 and a government source has said it was likely the other two also joined the insurgency in Iraq.The interior ministry said the five people arrested had helped Afalah and Belhadj escape and had been in touch with Ouhnane.In the raids, police seized false documents, receipts for telephone calls to Afghanistan, cash and three computers.The people arrested were named as Zohaib Khadiri, Djilali Boussiri, Nasreddine Ben Laid Amri, Samir Tahtah and Kamal Ahbar. The ministry did not give their nationalities.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-spain-arrests-idUSL0313574720070103</link><sectors><value><value>World</value></value></sectors><title>spain arrests 5 for possible ties to madrid bombers</title></story></items>
