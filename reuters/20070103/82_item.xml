billion in actual foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2007, the 
local Beijing News reported on Wednesday. The paper cited a report by the Chinese Academy of Social 
Sciences (CASS), a top government think-tank, as forecasting 
the figure would represent annual growth of about 4 percent 
compared with 2006, which would mean FDI of about $61.36 
billion last year. The official China Securities Journal quoted the Ministry 
of Commerce as saying that China was expected to attract $60.3 
billion in FDI in 2006, unchanged from 2005. State television has said the country would draw more than 
$72.4 billion in FDI in 2006, without giving any source. The Beijing News also cited the CASS report as saying China 
needed to restrict the inflow of speculative foreign capital 
and draft rules concerning foreign mergers and acquisitions in 
the world's fourth-largest economy. The commerce ministry said China's FDI in the first 11 
months of 2006 stood at $54.26 billion, up 2.14 percent from a 
year earlier. That figure does not include foreign direct 
investments in the financial sector.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/businesspro-china-economy-fdi-dc-idUSPEK14931120070103</link><sectors></sectors><title>china to attract $ 63 . 81 bln in fdi in 2007</title></story></items>
