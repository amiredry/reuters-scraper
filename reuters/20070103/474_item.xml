Applica Inc. APN.N on Wednesday said it entered a fourth
amendment to its merger deal with Harbinger Capital Partners,
matching an earlier increase to a rival bid by NACCO Industries
Inc. (NC.N). Applica urged shareholders to vote for the amended deal
from Harbinger Capital Partners, its largest shareholder,
offering $7.75 per share for all outstanding shares it does not
own. The latest amendment comes after NACCO earlier increased
its rival offer for Applica to $7.75 a share from $7.50 and
extended the expiration date of the tender offer to Jan. 17. Applica, which last month accepted a $7.50 per share offer
from Harbinger, said on Wednesday it plans to convene a special
meeting of shareholders on Jan. 4 and adjourn it until Jan 10.
The offers will be submitted to a shareholder vote on Jan. 10. In a statement on Wednesday, Applica said its board has
urged shareholders to reject the revised NACCO offer and not
tender their shares. If Harbinger Capital's proposal is approved by Applica
shareholders, NACCO has said it would pursue litigation against
Harbinger Capital based on its belief that it breached the July
2006 merger agreement with Applica.
