largest U.S. drugstore chain, said on Wednesday that sales at
its stores open at least a year rose 7.9 percent in December,
driven by stronger sales of prescription medications despite
the $4 generic plan in place at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT.N)
and other low-priced chains. Total sales rose 14.4 percent to $5.13 billion. Pharmacy same-store sales rose 9.6 percent, while
same-store sales of general, or front-end, merchandise rose 5.8
percent. Pharmacy sales accounted for 56.8 percent of sales in the
month, Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreen said.
