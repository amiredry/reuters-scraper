Transneft (TRNF_p.RTS) said on Wednesday Belarus had no right to
impose any new duty on transit of Russian oil across its
territory. "Belarus cannot impose any export or additional transit
duty, because the oil belongs to Russia," Transneft
Vice-President Sergei Grigoryev told Reuters. "As for the
transit shipping fee, it's set by inter-governmental agreements,
and therefore it cannot be changed without Russia's accord." "Therefore, we are not worried." Belarus said on Wednesday it had imposed a customs duty on
Russian crude oil exports across its territory, effective from
Jan. 1, 2007, amounting to $45 per tonne.
