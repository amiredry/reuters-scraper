It says its "pig soup," which uses pork fat for stock, is country fare much loved by French traditionalists."No-one has ever been able to prove that anyone has been refused soup or clothes on the grounds of their religion or race," SDF lawyer Frederic Pichon told France Info radio after Tuesday's court decision.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-france-soup-pork-idUSL0226439620070103</link><sectors><value><value>Oddly Enough</value></value></sectors><title>french court rules pork soup kitchen not racist</title></story></items>
