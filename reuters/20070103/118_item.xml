Cablevision Systems Corp.'s (CVC.N) controlling family in
selling its Rainbow Media unit, the New York Post reported on
Wednesday. Citing sources familiar with the matter, the Post said the
talks amount to "informal chatter between friendly moguls." Rainbow Media, which manages the AMC, IFC and WE: Women's
Entertainment cable television networks, is a subsidiary of
Cablevision, which is controlled by the Dolan family. The talks could become more serious as Cablevision
shareholders become increasingly restless with the company's
silence on a decision on the family's $19.2 billion buyout
proposal, the Post said, citing sources. Cablevision has set up a special committee to review the
family's offer, but has yet to publicly approve or reject it. A deal for Rainbow's programming assets could generate more
than $2 billion, the Post reported. A Cablevision spokesman declined to comment. Liberty
officials were not immediately available for comment. Malone last month agreed to swap an $11 billion stake in
News Corp. NWSa.N for control of satellite TV provider
DirecTV Group Inc. DTV.N and other assets.
