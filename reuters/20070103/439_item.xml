M. Rogers, from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, said in a statement.In a study of Michigan Medicare beneficiaries, 88 percent of female CABG patients received a blood transfusion compared with 67 percent of male patients.The infection rate was 15 percent for transfused patients but 5 percent rate among non-transfused patients.Patients who received a blood transfusion were 5.6-times more likely to die within 100 days of undergoing heart bypass surgery than were non-transfused patients, the report indicates.On initial analysis, it looked like female patients were more likely to die than their male counterparts. However, after taking account of who got transfusions and who didn't, there was no longer any significant mortality difference between women and men.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-transfusions-death-idUSSP16231320070103</link><sectors><value><value>Health</value></value></sectors><title>transfusions blamed for deaths after heart bypass</title></story></items>
