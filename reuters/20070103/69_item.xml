Ltd. DOX.N will buy Israeli start-up SigValue for $85 million,
financial news Web site TheMarker said on Wednesday. Company officials for Amdocs and SigValue were not
immediately available for comment. SigValue, a real-time cellular billing and messaging
applications start-up, solves the problem of billing prepaid
customers for use of added-value services such as SMS messaging
and purchases via cellular Internet. SigValue's sales for 2006 were over $10 million, TheMarker
said. Amdocs has 150 communications companies on its client list,
including vendors of regular phone services, cellular, cable TV,
satellite and Internet. SigValue would be the company's second Israeli acquisition
after XACCT, which it bought in 2004 for $29.5 million,
including $13.5 million in cash and 560,777 stocks.
