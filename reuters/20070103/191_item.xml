Sonus Networks Inc. (SONS.O) on Wednesday said it posted record
orders in the fourth quarter and full-year 2006, helped by
strong demand for Internet telephony (VoIP) infrastructure. The company also said Nasdaq's Listing Qualification Panel
will give it until Feb. 12, 2007 to file two past quarterly
reports and any required restatements following an internal
accounting probe.
