Wednesday said U.S. December vehicle sales fell 13 percent from
a year earlier, partly on lower demand for its F-Series pickup
trucks. The second-largest U.S. automaker said it sold 233,621
vehicles in the United States last month, down from 267,881
vehicles in December 2005. Results for Ford include its import brands and some medium-
and heavy-duty trucks and are not adjusted for the extra
selling day in December 2005. Ford reported full-year 2006 sales of 2.9 million, down 8
percent. Car sales were 5 percent higher than a year before for
the second year in a row. However, truck sales were down 14 percent in 2006 as higher
gasoline prices and a soft housing industry weighed on
full-size truck sales, the company said. Ford expects these factors to continue to weigh on the
segment in 2007. The company said end-of-year inventories totaled 590,000
units, 143,000 lower than at the end of 2005.  Less than 10
percent are 2006 models, it added.
