in 2006 but European investors who did not watch their currency
did not fare as well as bourse gains might suggest, data from
index compiler MSCI showed on Wednesday. With the euro rising a little over 11 percent against the
dollar EUR= last year, unhedged returns for euro investors
were diminished in many places. MSCI said, for example, that its flagship all-country world
index .MSCIWD rose 18.78 percent in dollar terms over the year
but just 6.25 percent in euros. There was a similar, if narrower, gap in MSCI's emerging
Latin America index, its best performing regional benchmark.
Euro investors gained 24.64 percent; dollar-based counterparts
39.34 percent. Meanwhile, the firm's top performing country index, China,
rose 59.33 percent in euro terms versus 78.12 percent in
dollars. Even at home, the unhedged euro investor lagged. MSCI's
Europe index gained 16.49 percent in euro terms. Dollar
investors saw it rise 30.22 percent as their currency sank.
