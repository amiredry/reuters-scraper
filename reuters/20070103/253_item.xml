trimmed early gains on Wednesday, lowering the implied chances
of a Federal Reserve rate cut in the first quarter after a
stronger-than-expected reading on December manufacturing. Implied chances of a Fed cut by March FFJ7 fell back to
the overnight level of 12 percent from as high as 18 percent in
early trading. Futures are fully priced for the Federal Open Market
Committee to hold rates steady at 5.25 percent at its January
30-31 meeting. The Institute for Supply Management said its December index
of manufacturing rose to 51.4, reversing November's decline and
confounding ideas that the report would show contraction in the
factory sector for a second straight month by holding under
50. "For the Fed it's a small piece of data, but everything
else being equal this would make them hold off from a cut,"
said Robert Macintosh, chief economist at Eaton Vance
Management in Boston. The ISM employment component rose marginally but at 49.7,
was below 50 for the third month of the past four. Rate futures prices have scaled back the implied prospects
for 2007 Fed rate cuts over the past week. The market is now
not especially confident that a cut will come in the first half
of the year.
