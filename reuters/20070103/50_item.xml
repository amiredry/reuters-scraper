group Sligro SLGN.AS said on Wednesday its 2006 sales rose 7.4
percent to 1.7 billion euros ($2.26 billion) on the acquisition
of Inversco in May 2006 and the opening of twelve new
supermarkets. The company did not say anything about the outlook for its
2006 net profit. In October Sligro said it expected 2006 net
profit to be a record of around 60 million euros. Sligro will publish full 2006 results on Jan. 25. Last year Sligro bought, jointly with Dutch retailer
Sperwer, 233 Edah supermarkets from Laurus LAUR.AS.
