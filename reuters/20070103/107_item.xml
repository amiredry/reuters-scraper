 Rating                Neutral             Overweight --J.P. Morgan Securities said while it is confident of a
2007 rebound of the implantable defibrillator market (ICD), it
is obviously still early in the trajectory. --J.P. Morgan said it still sees downside risk to estimates
owing to the challenges of the ICD market. It also said the
challenge for St. Jude is sustaining share gains in the face of
a likely rebound by Boston Scientific. --The brokerage said it prefers Medtronic Inc. (MDT.N),
which offers greater diversification and an acceleration story
across several of its businesses.
