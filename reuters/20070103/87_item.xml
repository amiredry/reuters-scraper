and Virgin Atlantic [VA.UL] on Wednesday denied media reports
which said they might take part in a global low-cost alliance
with Malaysian carrier AirAsia Bhd (AIRA.KL) or its owners.
"We are not joining any alliance," easyJet spokesman Toby
Nicol said. "The whole low-cost airline business model is based on
simplicity," he added, noting alliances with other airlines
involve costs and complications. Virgin Atlantic spokesman Paul Charles said: "It's nothing
to do with us. AirAsia clearly have their own plans and it is up
to them to announce them." Malaysian newspapers have reported that AirAsia, easyJet and
the Virgin Group were in talks to form a global no-frills
alliance that would offer cheap flights within Asia as well
between Europe and Australia via Kuala Lumpur. A source told Reuters that the major owners of AirAsia might
pursue a tie-up with the two airlines via FlyasianXpress (FAX),
a domestic Malaysian carrier they control.
