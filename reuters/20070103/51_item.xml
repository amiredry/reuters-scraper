Whatever happens to these currencies is reflected in the (trust's) returns," Witan Marketing Director James Budden said, noting that appointing a currency manager could generate returns of anything up to 2 percent.Over 700 million pounds of Witan's portfolio is held in non-sterling-denominated assets. Budden said the trust may move more of its foreign currency exposure to an external manager in future."Historically, currency managers have a good record of adding value. Their marketplace is incredibly liquid yet inefficient," the trust's Chief Executive Jim Horsburgh said in the statement.Budden also said the trust may shift assets away from some of its external fund managers after disappointing performances."There will be some changes in the next few months ... No decision has been made, but one or two have not done as well as they might have done," he said.He said the trust may also move assets away from a UK enhanced index mandate, run by Henderson Global Investors, which aims to beat index returns by exploiting market anomalies.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/witan-mellon-idUSNOA32736020070103</link><sectors></sectors><title>witan trust appoints mellon as currency manager</title></story></items>
