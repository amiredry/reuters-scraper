Corp. (SONC.O) on Wednesday reported lower quarterly earnings
as higher interest expense offset a rise in sales. Net income for the fiscal first quarter was $15.3 million,
or 19 cents per share, compared with $16.4 million, or 18 cents
per share, in the year-ago period. In November, Sonic said first-quarter earnings would be at
the low-end of its 19 cents to 20 cents per share estimate. Excluding one-time items, Sonic earned 20 cents per share,
the company said. During the quarter, Sonic, which operates drive-in and
driver-thru restaurants, bought back about 20 percent of its
outstanding shares. Total revenue rose 9 percent to $174.8 million. Sales at
restaurants open at least a year, or same-store sales, rose 3.4
percent during the quarter. Sonic expects to open between 180 and 200 outlets in 2007,
most of which will be franchised. In the second quarter, Sonic expects to earn 9 cents to 10
cents a share, including refinancing charges. Wall Street
analysts were expecting earnings of 16 cents a share, excluding
items, according to Reuters Estimates. Same-store sales are expected to rise between 2 percent and
4 percent, Sonic said. Total revenue is expected to rise between 9 percent and 11
percent. Sonic shares closed at $23.87 Wednesday on Nasdaq.
