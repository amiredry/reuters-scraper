Wednesday, pushing the Dow industrials to an intraday record
high and the Nasdaq index up 1 percent, with shares of Wal-Mart
Stores Inc.(WMT.N) jumping after a stronger-than-expected sales
forecast. Stock in Home Depot Inc. (HD.N) also gained sharply after
the resignation of its chairman and chief executive revived
takeover talk, while lower oil prices helped the outlook for
stocks. For details, see [ID:nN30286457] On the Nasdaq, shares of Google Inc. (GOOG.O) rose. Stifel
Nicolaus said Google has replaced eBay Inc. (EBAY.O) on its
select list. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 80.19
points, or 0.64 percent, at 12,543.34. The Standard &amp; Poor's
500 Index .SPX was up 6.61 points, or 0.47 percent, at
1,424.91. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 24.13
points, or 1.00 percent, at 2,439.42. "You're getting an inflow of reinvestment funds at the
beginning of the year and normally you do get some upward
pressure on the market in the initial sessions," said Michael
Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New
York. Shares of Wal-Mart rose 3.4 percent to $47.76, while shares
of Home Depot gained 3.5 percent to $41.55. Shares of Google
increased 1.2 percent to $465.88. Crude oil slipped below $60 a barrel as mild weather in the
U.S. Northeast lessened demand for fuel there. [ID:nSP161243].
