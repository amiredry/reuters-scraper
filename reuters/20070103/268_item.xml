again raised its offer price for household appliance maker
Applica Inc. APN.N to $7.75 a share from $7.50 and extended
the expiration date of the tender offer to Jan. 17. Applica had last month accepted a $7.50 per share offer
from its largest shareholder, Harbinger Capital Partners. NACCO, an appliance distributor, had earlier raised its
offer to $7.50 a share from $7. Applica had convened its shareholders' meeting on Jan. 4 to
vote on the proposed Harbinger Capital merger. If Harbinger Capital's proposal is approved by Applica
shareholders, NACCO said it would pursue litigation against
Harbinger Capital, based on its belief that it breached the
July 2006 merger agreement with Applica.
