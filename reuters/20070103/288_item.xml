Stock Exchange dropped more than 100 points on Wednesday
morning, as investors drove down resource and energy shares on
weakness in the underlying commodities. The S&amp;P/TSX composite index fell 105.93 points, or 0.82
percent, to 12,817.73 shortly before 11 a.m., erasing the
modest 15-point gain booked in Tuesday's session. Six of the benchmark's main 10 groups advanced, but the
heavyweight energy and materials groups were among the
decliners, pushing down the overall market. Energy fell 3 percent, while materials -- which includes
resources and gold-miner shares -- fell 1.9 percent. Zinc giant Teck Cominco Ltd. (TCKb.TO) dove C$5.78, or 6.7
percent, to C$80.15. Inmet Mining IMN.TO fell C$4.94, or 8.1
percent, to C$55.84. Among energy shares, EnCana Corp. (ECA.TO) slid C$1.73, or
3.2 percent, to C$52.62. The declines came as oil fell to below $60 a barrel, thanks
to warm U.S. weather which cut heating-oil demand. Base metals
also paced lower, led by copper prices, which touched their
lowest levels since April. ($1=$1.17 Canadian)
