main index slid shortly after market open on Wednesday as
weaker resource and energy shares pulled the broader benchmark
into the red. The S&amp;P/TSX composite index was down 24.00 points, or 0.2
percent, at 12,899.66 shortly after the year's second session
kicked off, reversing the 15-point gain made on Tuesday. Six of the composite's main 10 groups advanced. But the
heavyweight materials sector, which includes gold miners, and
the energy sector lost 0.74 percent and 1.1 percent,
respectively. The key groups' declines reflected softness in their
underlying commodity prices. Oil fell toward $60.50 a barrel as
warm weather in the United States ate into heating oil demand.
Base metals also fell, dragged down by copper prices which
touched their lowest levels since early April. Zinc giant Teck Cominco Ltd. (TCKb.TO) was among the
biggest losers, giving up C$2.95, or 3.4 percent, to C$82.98.
Energy giant EnCana Corp. (ECA.TO) eased 90 Canadian cents to
C$53.45. ($1=$1.17 Canadian)
