In some cases, women who marry against their families' will and their in-laws are disfigured as punishment.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-pakistan-honour-idUSISL15336720070103</link><sectors><value><value>World</value></value></sectors><title>pakistan man loses ears , nose for love marriage</title></story></items>
