AAI.N said on Wednesday it expects to report "a modest loss"
for the fourth quarter, but to be profitable for full-year
2006, due to a decline in load factor and weaker yields from
increased competition along the East Coast. The company said its December load factor rose 0.4 percent
from a year earlier to 70.4 percent, but was down 2.5 points to
69 percent for the fourth quarter.
