considering forcing bond holders to accept a buy back of the
country's global bonds due in 2012 by threatening not to pay
interest, designated Economy Minister Ricardo Patino said on
Wednesday. Patino, who was named by President-elect Rafael Correa as
his economy minister, was asked if he had considered announcing
that the government would not pay interest to force creditors
to accept a buy back to be managed through a Dutch auction. "This is an alternative and we are studying several
alternatives," answered Patino in a television program, without
giving more details. A Dutch auction starts with a asking price that moves
downward until it is accepted by a bidder. Correa, who will be sworn in as president later this month,
has caused jitters on Wall street with threats to interrupt
bond payments as he seeks to lower the Andean country's debt
burden.
