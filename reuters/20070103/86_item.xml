Britain's leading shares nosed down 0.05 percent in early
trading on Wednesday, with miners falling after a strong sector
performance on Tuesday, led down by Vedanta Resources (VED.L). Precious metal prices and most base metal prices edged up,
but this failed to prevent a sector decline. Vedanta Resources
(VED.L) fell 2.7 percent while Xstrata XTA.L and Antofagasta
(ANTO.L) each slipped about 2 percent. "The mining stocks got squeezed up yesterday, and they are
giving up the gains they made then," said a market maker. By 0837 GMT, the FTSE 100 index fell 3.8 points, to 6,307.1.
Economic data from the U.S. including on manufacturing,
construction spending and jobs, will provide a steer on the
health of the country's economy, which may influence UK stocks,
traders said. The Federal Open Market Committee minutes due after the
close at 1900 GMT will come too late to have impact on the UK
market on Wednesday, traders said. "The U.S. market will for once be playing catch up with
European markets because it was closed yesterday," said a
trader. Heavyweight oil stocks were mixed after oil prices held
below $61 a barrel as mild weather conditions were projected to
persist in the U.S., undermining heating oil demand.  Royal
Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) fell 0.1 percent but BP (BP.L) rose 0.3
percent. A UBS sector comment note boosted the banking sector. Key
picks were Barclays (BARC.L), which rose 0.7 percent, and RBS
(RBS.L), which rose 0.4 percent after UBS said it was the
cheapest large bank anywhere. Among the least favoured stocks by
UBS was Northern Rock NRK.L, which slipped 0.1 percent. HSBC Holdings (HSBA.L) gained 0.3 percent on news that the
banking group had appointed Simon Robertson, a City of London
adviser, to be its leading non-executive director. Among media stocks, British satellite broadcaster BSkyB
BSY.L rose 0.2 percent on news it is to launch a
video-on-demand service and develop its Sky+ digital recorder to
boost its pay TV offering in 2007.
