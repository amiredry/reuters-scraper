insurance broker Aon Corp. AOC.N, said on Wednesday it would
expand its business that helps companies deal with risks
ranging from embezzlement and bribery to sexual harrassment. The establishment of a threat management and security
services unit will help make Aon more competitive with Kroll,
the risk management business owned by its chief competitor,
Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos. Inc. (MMC.N). The head of the new unit, Gregory Boles, formerly headed
Kroll's threat management unit and is a 25-year veteran of the
Los Angeles Police Department. Aon said the new unit would help companies identify and
stop both internal and external threats, including workplace
violence response and prevention training, crisis management,
executive protection, travel intelligence and risk management. Aon's expansion comes at a time when Kroll is retrenching
in some areas. On Dec. 7, Kroll said it had sold Kroll Security
International, which provides security in Iraq and Afghanistan,
to Canada's Garda World Security Corp. GW.TO because the work
had become less profitable and more dangerous. Despite the sale, Kroll expects about $1 billion in revenue
in 2006, according to a Dec. 7 presentation by the company. Aon declined to comment on the revenue of its investigative
service group.
