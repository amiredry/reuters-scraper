Domestic consumption generates about half of economic activity while tourism accounts for 6 percent.The stock index .SETI closed down 3.03 percent at 659.25 points in the exchange's first day of trade since the blasts. It fell as much as 3.93 percent to 653.14 points in early trade, its lowest since December 20.The bombs, which the military-installed government blamed on former politicians while admitting it had no clear idea who ordered them, killed three people, wounded 38, including nine foreigners, and ruined New Year celebrations.How the government handled the problem would be a major factor in how long the impact of the bombs on the financial markets lasted, said Asia Plus Securities (ASP.BK) chief executive Kongkiat Opaswongkarn."It's too early to say that the impact would be short term as all eyes are now focusing on the government's unfoldings of the situation," he said as several bomb scares jangled nerves further."Of course, the baht will automatically be weakened as the authorities have imposed unfriendly measures to curb the baht," Kongkiat said of the central bank's imposition of some capital controls last month to restrain the currency's rise.The baht, Asia's fastest-rising currency against the dollar last year with an almost 14 percent rise, was trading at 35.90/36.00 baht per dollar, down from 35.46 late on Tuesday.BONDS MIXEDBond yields &lt;0#THTSY=&gt; on the secondary market were mixed, with long yields rising due to greater supply, but trade was thin as many investors were still away from the market, dealers said.Bid yields on two-year bonds THLB09NC= fell 5 basis points (bps), but five-year bond yields THLB123A= rose 9 bps to 5.2 percent. Twelve-year bond yields THLB19DA= rose 2 bps to 5.57 percent.Dealers said the bombs might draw investors into shifting to debt paper if stocks continued to perform poorly.Among big cap shares, PTT (PTT.BK), Thailand's biggest energy firm, fell 2.9 percent to 204 baht.Siam Cement (SCC.BK), the biggest industrial conglomerate, was 3.3 percent lower at 234 baht, while Advanced Info Service ADVA.BK, the leading mobile phone firm, dropped 1.9 percent to 76 baht.Shares in tourism-related firms also suffered.National carrier Thai Airways (THAI.BK) sank 7.9 percent to 40.75 baht, airport operator Airports of Thailand (AOT.BK) fell 5.1 percent to 55.5 baht and hotelier Minor International (MINT.BK) tumbled 8.4 percent to 10.9 baht.The bomb scares also hit department store shares. Central Pattana (CPN.BK), the country's biggest retail store operator, fell almost 8 percent to 20.8 baht.Hypermarket chain operator Big C Supercenter (BIGC.BK), 63 percent owned by French supermarket operator Casino Group (CASP.PA), fell 3.2 percent to 46 baht and Robinson Department Store ROBI.BK was 1.8 percent lower at 11 baht.Concern about domestic turmoil would continue to push foreign investors away despite the Thai stock market's cheap valuation, analysts said.The Bangkok bourse was trading at 8 times price to earnings ratio compared with 13-16 times of other Southeast Asian markets."The market will obviously be bearish in the short-to-medium term with continued foreign fund outflows largely because we have too many problems right now," Warut of Globlex Securities said.The Thai bourse ended 2006 as Asia's worst-performing major index, down 4.75 percent after shock currency controls triggered a foreign-led sell-off late in the year.Months of street protests which ended with the ouster of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in a bloodless September 19 coup also made 2006 a turbulent year for Thai stocks.The shock capital controls imposed on December 18, which drove the stock index down nearly 15 percent, were aimed at slowing the baht's surge but sent many foreign investors rushing for the door.Foreign investors ended the year net buyers of Thai shares worth 83 billion baht ($2.3 billion), compared with net purchases of shares worth 118.8 billion baht in 2005."The index could come under pressure for months as foreign investors seek opportunity to switch their portfolio to lower risk markets such as the Philippines, or Hong Kong," Siam City Securities analyst Sukit Udomsirikul said.(Additional reporting by Orathai Sriring)</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-markets-thailand-stocks-idUSBKK00017320070103</link><sectors><value><value>Asian Markets</value></value></sectors><title>thai stocks fall as bombs jangle nerves</title></story></items>
