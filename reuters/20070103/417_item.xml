of British Columbia got a welcome respite on Wednesday from a
two-month volley of winter storms, insurers said damage from
flooding and hurricane-strength winds will cost them an
estimated C$80 million ($68 million). Canada's West Coast was pummeled by heavy rain in November,
flooding roads and basements, and causing dozens of landslides
and a building under construction in Vancouver to collapse. December brought more rain and hurricane-force winds that
knocked out power to a quarter of a million residents, blew off
roofs and felled an estimated 3,000 trees, some 500 years old,
in Vancouver's Stanley Park. Serge Corbeil, a spokesman for the Insurance Bureau of
Canada, said the damage for some homeowners was significant but
overall well below the C$200 million insurance bill after fires
torched British Columbia's southern Interior region in 2003. In
1998, insurers were hit for C$1.2 billion after an ice storm in
Quebec, he said. Bryan Seaton, a spokesman for ING Canada Inc. IIC.TO, the
biggest insurer of personal property in British Columbia, said
the firm's exposure was "fairly minimal". With a 14 percent
market share, ING's exposure would be around C$11 million. ING's net income in the third quarter was C$157 million. BCAA Insurance, another of the province's large property
and auto insurers, said it received over five times the usual
number of claims for wind damage for this time of the year.
Claims were mostly for collapsed fences, roof and shingle
damage, trees falling on structures and power outages causing
permanent damage to electrical equipment.  ($1=$1.17 Canadian)
