permanently shut three aging coal-fired electric generating
units at its Rockdale, Texas, smelter before the end of 2006 as
part of a consent decree signed in 2003, a company spokesman
said on Wednesday. Shutting the coal units will have no impact on aluminum
production at the plant, said Alcoa spokesman Kevin Lowery. The
smelter, located about 130 miles northwest of Houston, is being
supplied with power from a fourth generator at Rockdale owned
by Dallas-based TXU Corp. TXU.N and through open-market
purchases, Lowery said. The aluminum company agreed to replace the trio of
1950s-era coal units at the Sandow power station to settle a
lawsuit brought by environmental groups. Each unit was rated at
121 MW. Alcoa is working with TXU to build a 600-MW coal-fired unit
at the Sandow site to replace the dirtier units, but the air
permit remains subject to court action. Plans to move forward with Sandow 5 have not been finalized
yet, Lowery said. Under a TXU plan announced in 2006, the Sandow 5 plant was
scheduled to be the first of nine new coal plants TXU wants to
build to help meet growing demand for electricity in Texas. TXU
originally planned to begin construction of Sandow 5 last year
and begin operating in 2009, but has been unable to assume the
air permit needed to begin work. TXU has selected construction and engineering company
Bechtel to design and build Sandow 5 in Milam County.
