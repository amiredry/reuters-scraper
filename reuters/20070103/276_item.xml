 Rating              Sell               Hold 
 Price target        $34                $35 --Citigroup said Amazon's current valuation implies a level
of operating margin expansion that is not attainable. --The brokerage said it expects the Amazon's operating
margins to expand in the near term as it cuts back on research
and development spend but sees long-term GAAP operating margins
capped in the 6 percent range rather than the 7 percent range
implied by current valuation. --Citigroup said it sees the company's margin cap being
driven by rising online advertising costs, gross margin
pressure due to the shift from higher margin media sales and
aggressive pricing and shipping promotions requirements due to
increased competition, among other factors. --Shares of the company were down more than 2 percent at
$38.49 in morning trade on the Nasdaq.
