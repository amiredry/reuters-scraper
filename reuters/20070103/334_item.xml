on Wednesday they had at least partially matched a limited fare
increase last week by low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines
(LUV.N). The increase, which comes on the heels of a broader fare
hike by carriers earlier in December, points to airlines'
expectations of healthy demand and supports analysts' generally
upbeat outlook for the industry this year. Southwest said high fuel prices necessitated the Dec. 29
fare increase, which affects about 25 percent of the carrier's
passengers. "We are still very much in a high fuel
environment," said Southwest spokeswoman Beth Harbin. The carrier raised fares on routes of less than 400 miles
by $2 each way. On routes between 400 and 750 miles, Southwest
raised fares by $3 each way. UAL Corp's UAUA.O United Airlines, Northwest Airlines
NWACQ.PK, Delta Air Lines DALRQ.PK, Continental Airlines
(CAL.N) and AMR Corp's AMR.N American Airlines each said they
too had raised fares in response to Southwest's increase. Typically, airlines tend to rescind fare increases if
rivals do not match them. Last year, carriers managed to
implement several lasting fare increases and investors expect
them to continue doing so. Expectations for higher fares in 2007 helped push up
airline stocks on Wednesday. AMR shares were up more than 9
percent at $32.99 at midday. Other carriers posted smaller
percentage gains. The Amex airline index .XAL was up 4 percent. Southwest
shares were up 1.8 percent at $15.60 on the New York Stock
Exchange.
