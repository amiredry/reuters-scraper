(PHG.AS)(PHG.N) will take a 70 million euro ($93 million)
non-cash charge for its 17.5 percent stake in TPO Display Corp,
Philips said on Wednesday. Philips said in a statement the charge was "triggered by a
prolonged reduction in TPO's share price" and would be taken in
Philips' fourth-quarter results. Philips also announced a 41.7 million euro one-time gain in
the fourth quarter for the sale of its Philips Sound Solutions
unit which was completed on Dec. 31.
