Technologies Inc. (TTI.N) lowered its 2006 earnings outlook and
forecast a 2007 profit below consensus estimates. Shares of the company were down 7.1 percent at $23.76 in
early trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The company said 2006 earnings were hurt from the
unavailability of three modified dive support vessels in the
fourth quarter, substantial costs on turn-key platform
decommissioning contracts and other factors that could cost up
to 10 cents a share in the fourth quarter. Tetra Tech now sees 2006 earnings of $1.35 to $1.40 a
share. In November, it forecast $1.40 to $1.52 a share for the
year. For 2007, the company said it sees earnings of $1.80 to
$2.15 a share, on revenue of $1.12 billion to $1.24 billion. Analysts on average are expecting $1.50 a share for 2006
and $2.20 for 2007, both before special items, according to
Reuters Estimates.
