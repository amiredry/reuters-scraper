watchdog AMF said on Wednesday that it would decide on Jan. 9 on
a date by which the Artemis holding firm of the Pinault family
needs to file a formal bid for the shares of Suez LYOE.PA. In case Artemis would not make such an offer before or on
the specified date, AMF will order it to abstain from any offer
approach for a period of six months.
