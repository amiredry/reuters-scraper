trimmed early gains on Wednesday, lowering the implied chances
of a Federal Reserve rate cut in the first quarter after a
stronger-than-expected reading on December manufacturing. Implied chances of a Fed cut by March FFJ7 fell to the
overnight level of 12 percent from as high as 18 percent in
early trading. The Institute for Supply Management said its December index
of manufacturing rose to 51.4 from 49.5, confounding forecasts
that the report would show contraction in the factory sector
for a second straight month.
