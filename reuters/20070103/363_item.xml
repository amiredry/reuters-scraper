futures extended gains on Wednesday, raising the implied
chances of a Federal Reserve rate cut during the first half of
2007 after the release of minutes from the Fed's December
meeting. Implied chances of a Fed cut by March FFJ7 held at 12
percent, similar to levels seen earlier, but chances of a cut
by June EDM7 are at 84 percent, up from 80 percent. Minutes from the Dec. 12 Fed meeting showed that
policy-makers were still worried that inflation would not slow
as hoped, but also cited an increase in risks to economic
growth.
