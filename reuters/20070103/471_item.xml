main index closed down more than 200 points on Wednesday
following a steep pullback in metal and oil prices, which
weighed on the broader market. The Toronto Stock Exchange S&amp;P/TSX composite index
.GSPTSE  closed down 222.22 points, or 1.7 percent, at
12,701.44. Eight of the TSX index's 10 main groups retreated but the
hefty energy and materials groups, which include resources and
gold-mining shares, were the biggest losers, down 3.9 percent
and 4 percent respectively. The steep dive in energy issues was pegged on the slide in
oil, which dropped more than 4 percent to settle below $59 a
barrel, as unusually warm weather in the U.S. Northeast cut
heating-oil demand in the world's biggest energy market. Copper prices tumbled to their lowest levels since early
April, which weighed on other base metals. "The overriding reason is potential for slower growth this
year weighing on commodity markets," said Fergal Smith,
managing market strategist at Action Economics. "Then, of course, the energy sector has had to contend with
warmer weather forecasts," he added. "These are quite big moves
in percentage terms." Natural gas heavy EnCana Corp. (ECA.TO) closed down C$1.14,
or 2 percent, at C$53.21, Suncor Energy Inc. (SU.TO) slid
C$4.41, or 4.9 percent, to C$86.61. Zinc major Teck Cominco Ltd. (TCKb.TO) sagged C$4.53, or
5.3 percent, to C$81.40, while aluminum producer Alcan Inc.
AL.TO lost C$2.38, or 4.2 percent, to close at C$53.91. ($1=$1.17 Canadian)
