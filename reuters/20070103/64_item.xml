known for playing Gandalf in the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, 
has signed on for another fantasy. He will voice the narrator role in "Stardust," whose cast 
includes Claire Danes, Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer. Production wrapped in the fall. McKellen is recording his 
part during postproduction before "Stardust's" July 27 release 
date via Paramount Pictures. The film centers on a young man who promises his beloved 
that he will retrieve a fallen star by venturing into the 
Faerie realm, where he encounters witches, goblins, gnomes, 
talking animals and evil trees. Matthew Vaughn directed from an adaptation of Neil Gaiman's 
novel, which was published a year after the story debuted in 
1997 as a four-issue DC Comics miniseries. McKellen, a two-time Oscar nominee for his roles in "The 
Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" and "Gods and 
Monsters," appeared in two of the biggest hits of 2006: "The Da 
Vinci Code" and "X-Men: The Last Stand." Reuters/Hollywood Reporter</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/film-mckellen-dc-idUSN0228359120070103</link><sectors><value><value>Film</value></value></sectors><title>mckellen wishes upon a stardust</title></story></items>
