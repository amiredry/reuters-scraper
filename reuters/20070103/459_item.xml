Sergio Cabral Filho gave no exact time for the deployment of the military policemen, but said that he would also request the additional support of federal troops to curb the violence that surged last week in the tourist and business center."In the first instance, the presence will be on the state border," Cabral told reporters after a meeting with the National Public Security Secretary Luiz Fernando Correa and other officials.On Monday, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva described the attacks in which seven people were burned alive on one bus and two policemen were shot dead, as "terrorism" that needed to be treated with the strong hand of the Brazilian state.Rio is a major tourist destination and business center, and will host a summit of presidents from the South American Mercosur trade bloc later this month. It will also host the Pan American Games in July.The national security force was created by Lula in 2004 and consists of 7,700 men. It has been deployed twice in the state of Espirito Santo and once in Mato Grosso do Sul to contain waves of civilian and prison violence.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-brazil-security-rio-idUSN0337662820070103</link><sectors><value><value>World</value></value></sectors><title>brazil to send force to cut rio violence</title></story></items>
