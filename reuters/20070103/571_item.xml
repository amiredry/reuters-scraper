She declined to say exactly when Entwistle was admitted.The Boston Herald said he was transferred after authorities found a note containing instructions on how he wished to be buried. Entwistle addressed the letter to his parents and said it may be his last, asking for his ashes to be spread over his wife's and daughter's graves.Authorities declined to comment on the letter, which the newspaper said was discovered just two days after Entwistle was denied bail on December 19 by a Massachusetts judge.Entwistle was indicted for fatally shooting his wife, Rachel Souza Entwistle, and their 9-month-old daughter Lillian Rose as they lay in bed in their home in the middle-class town of Hopkinton outside of Boston on January 20, 2006. He had fled to England but was arrested and extradited back to America.Entwistle's Attorney, Elliot Weinstein, and local police involved in the case declined to comment on the matter.If convicted, Entwistle could serve life in prison without a chance of parole.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-entwistle-hospital-idUSN0343888120070103</link><sectors><value><value>U.S.</value></value></sectors><title>briton accused of u . s . double murders hospitalized</title></story></items>
