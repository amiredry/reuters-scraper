hotels group Accor (ACCP.PA), is one of five candidates in the 
race to buy tour operator Go Voyages from his former company, 
according to the La Tribune newspaper in an article to be 
published on Thursday. It said Accor planned to sell Go Voyages for 200 million to 
250 million euros ($331.9 million) and that Financiere Agache 
Investissements was one of five potential buyers. Agache is run by Espalioux and is a subsidiary of a holding 
company controlled by France's richest man, Bernard Arnault. The other potential buyers are two funds and two foreign 
companies, La Tribune said, adding that the management of Go 
Voyages was seeking backers of a leveraged buyout. The five remaining candidates have had access to a data 
room at Go Voyages since December and need to file an offer 
with Deutsche Bank by January 22. A decision was due early February, the paper said. Accor was not immediately available for comment. In November, the Les Echos news paper said there were 30 
potential buyers for Go Voyages and named Barclays Private 
Equity, AXA Private Equity and CDC Entreprises. Go Voyages, which calls itself France's leading specialized 
operator in the retail of scheduled and chartered flights, had 
sales in the 2005-2006 financial year of 400 million euros. It is also a big player in the online booking market. Accor announced its intention to sell Go Voyages, as well 
as its Gemeaz Cusin Italian catering unit, as part of a 500 
million euros asset sale plan.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/04/businesspro-govoyages-espalioux-dc-idUSL0324150320070104</link><sectors></sectors><title>espalioux among candidates for go voyages , paper says</title></story></items>
