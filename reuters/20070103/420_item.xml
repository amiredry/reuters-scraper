Their average age was 99.2 years.Overall, 29 percent of the subjects with good cognitive function had the V type CETP gene, compared to 14 percent with poor cognitive function. Looked at the other way, 61 percent of those with the V type had good cognitive function versus 30 percent of those with another type, the investigators report in the medical journal Neurology.The team then studied 173 subjects from the Einstein Aging Study to confirm the role of CETP in a younger cohort. The CETP V type was approximately five times more common in subjects without dementia than in those with dementia."It's possible that this gene variant also protects against the development of Alzheimer's disease," study author Nir Barzilai, of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, comments in a press release."Little effort has been made to identify the reasons for longevity in exceptionally old people, and why they don't develop disease," Barzilai said. "In studying these centenarians, we hope to learn what factors lessen their risk for diseases that affect the general population at a much younger age."</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-gene-longevity-idUSSP16391420070103</link><sectors><value><value>Health</value></value></sectors><title>want longevity and a sharp mind ? it ' s in the genes</title></story></items>
