narrowed on Wednesday as weak private sector jobs data and
growth-wary minutes from the Federal Reserve pushed Treasury
bond yields lower. Two-year swap spreads were steady at 35.50 basis points,
while ten-year swap spreads widened to 47.75 basis points from
47.50 basis points on Friday before the holiday weekend. Ten-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR were up 4/32 in price,
yielding 4.67 percent, compared with 4.77 percent on Tuesday. The market was caught between a negative reading in the ADP
survey of private sector jobs, which forced an early rally, and
data showing the manufacturing sector rebounded in December. Minutes from the Fed emphasizing the risks to economic
growth also pushed bond prices higher, contributing to the
narrowing of rate spreads.
