likely declined by 40,000 in December, suggesting an abrupt
slowing of employment, a private employment service report
showed on Wednesday. The monthly ADP National Employment Report showed the
decline in December was the first since early 2003, according
to a graph released with the report. Private sector employers
added 158,000 jobs in November. The report is based on payroll data and measures the change
in total private sector nonfarm employment each month. The median forecast for the ADP survey from 10 economists
surveyed by Reuters pointed to a reading of 128,000 jobs for
the December ADP report. The report is released each month, two days before the
government's own job survey of a net gain in nonfarm jobs in
the U.S. private and public sectors. It is jointly developed
with Macroeconomic Advisers LLC. Automatic Data Processing, based in Roseland, New Jersey,
is the parent of ADP Employer Services and is a large payroll
services company. Macroeconomic Advisers LLC is based in St.
Louis, Missouri. According to the latest Reuters poll of economists, U.S.
Labor Department data on Friday is expected to show that
110,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were created in December, down
from 132,000 in November.
