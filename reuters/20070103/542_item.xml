Giants running back Tiki Barber is in negotiations to 
contribute to ABC's "Good Morning America" and perhaps ESPN's 
football coverage. A report Tuesday in the New York Post said Barber had 
signed a four-year, $10 million contract, but sources said 
Tuesday that it wasn't true. ESPN and ABC News declined comment Tuesday. The 10-year veteran said last year that this season would 
be his last in the NFL. His stellar performance in his last 
regular-season game Saturday against Washington gave the Giants 
the boost they needed to get into the playoffs. Barber's playoff commitment -- the Giants play the 
Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday -- means that any announcement 
will be delayed until after his playing career is over. Barber has drawn interest from several networks vying for 
his services; he has made regular appearances on Fox News 
Channel's "Fox &amp; Friends" in the past year.
