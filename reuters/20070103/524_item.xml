downgraded the shares of companies that supply equipment to
make microchips, citing weakness in the group because of high
inventories and rich valuations. In lowering its rating on the group to "cautious" from
"neutral," Goldman downgraded Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT.O)
and Credence Systems Corp. CMOS.O to "sell" from "neutral,"
on expectation of weak fundamentals, among other factors. Credence shares fell 3.1 percent to close at $5.04, while
those of Applied Materials dipped 0.2 percent to close at
$18.42 on the Nasdaq. The brokerage also cut Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD.N
to "sell" from "neutral," citing a rise in fixed costs, a weak
pricing environment, and increasing competition from Intel
Corp. (INTC.O) in the first half of 2007. AMD shares fell nearly 4.1 percent to close at $19.52 on
the New York Stock Exchange while Intel shares finished up 0.5
percent at $20.35. Goldman Sachs also upgraded Texas Instruments Inc. TXN.N,
the top maker of cellphone processors, and memory chip maker
Micron Technology Inc. MU.N to "neutral" from "sell," saying
that underperformance of those companies in 2006 had limited
the downside to the stock price. Texas Instruments shares fell 0.8 percent to $28.56 while
Micron stock rose 0.5 percent to $14.03. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange's semiconductor index of
chip and chip equipment companies .SOXX fell 0.6 percent to
465.06.
