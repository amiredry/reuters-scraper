Wednesday, paring earlier gains after the ADP National
Employment Report said that U.S. private sector employment
likely posted a surprise decline in December. Private sector jobs likely fell by 40,000 in the month,
compared to consensus forecasts for a rise of almost 130,000
jobs. The euro was trading down 0.25 percent on the day at
$1.3246 EUR=, compared to around $1.3130 before the release
of the data.
