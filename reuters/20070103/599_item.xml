objected to auto parts maker Delphi Corp.'s DPHIQ.PK proposed
$3.4 billion bankruptcy-emergence agreement with an investor
group led by Cerberus Capital Management LP and Appaloosa
Management LP. The trustee's response follows earlier objections by a
committee representing stockholders, a union that represents
Delphi hourly workers and Highland Capital Management LP, which
has proposed an alternate $4.7 billion offer. Delphi, which filed for bankruptcy protection in October
2005, disclosed the proposed investment by the Cerberus and
Appaloosa-led group Dec. 18 and an outline for treating various
creditors. Highland made its proposal Dec. 21. The agreement calls for millions of dollars of fees and
expenses to professionals for the investors funding Delphi's
emergence without oversight, the trustee, Diana Adams, said in
court papers. The framework agreement also appears to dictate many terms
of the reorganization, circumventing the disclosure statement
and confirmation approval processes, and restricts
participation in plan negotiations, Adams said. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain has set a hearing for Jan. 11
in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New
York to consider whether to approve the equity investment and
framework agreements. Troy, Michigan-based Delphi was spun off by General Motors
Corp. (GM.N) in 1999. It plans to cut thousands of workers in
the United States, 21 of 29 U.S. union plants and exit several
business lines to reorganize its operations.
