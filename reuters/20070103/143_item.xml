said it will offer Yahoo Inc.'s (YHOO.O) local search service as
an option for drivers using Dash's navigation system. When a user enters their search term into their Dash
Express, the device wirelessly begins a Yahoo! Local search,
and presents results as a listing of nearby businesses, Dash
said. The company said the Dash Express is scheduled for
availability in California in the spring of 2007 and nationwide
in the fall of 2007.
