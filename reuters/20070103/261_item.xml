Wednesday it sold 6.5 million shares privately for $3.90 each,
well below their closing price on Friday, in a move that pulled
the company's public shares as much as 12.3 percent lower. The issuance is generating about $23.7 million of funds for
NetBank, which has not posted a profit since the fourth quarter
of 2005. The online bank and mortgage lender plans to use the
proceeds for regular business activities. NetBank is struggling to grow amid a difficult interest
rate environment for banks. The short-term rates at which banks
borrow are very close to the long-term rates at which they
lend, which shrinks margins. NetBank's growth may also be limited by the fact that it
mainly works with consumers online, said Peyton Green, an
analyst at FTN Midwest Securities in Nashville. Most major U.S.
banks offer online banking, but most are also boosting their
branch networks to serve customers who want to work with
humans. Younger consumers are more comfortable with Internet
banking, but older customers, who tend to have more assets,
often prefer banking at branches, "There's a place for Internet banking, but the question is,
how big can an Internet-only bank be?" Green said. NetBank's shares were down 24 cents at $4.40 in morning
trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange, after falling to as low
as $4.07. NetBank's privately placed shares are not yet registered
and cannot be traded, which is why they are worth less than the
company's public shares, analysts said.
