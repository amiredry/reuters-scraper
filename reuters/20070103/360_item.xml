and founder Philip Knight sold over 320,000 shares of Class B
common stock in the last week of December through a prearranged
stock trading plan, according to regulatory filings made on
Wednesday. On Dec. 29, Knight sold 77,772 shares of Nike stock under a
Rule 10b5-1 Plan, in which stock trades are automatically
spread over a designated period of time, the documents filed
with the U.S. Securities &amp; Exchange Commission said. From Dec. 26 to 28, Knight also sold 245,121 shares of
common stock under the trading plan. Share prices ranged from $98.80 to $100.42. Rule 10b5-1 allows executives who might otherwise be barred
from trading due to their access to material nonpublic
information to sell shares via a plan arranged in advance. Shares of Nike, the world's largest maker of athletic shoes
and apparel, fell 0.6 percent, or 63 cents, to $98.40 to
mid-afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.
