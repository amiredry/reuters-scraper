In recent months, the stock has recovered, trading as high as $513 in late November.The stock, which opened around $465 following the holidays was up $10 at $475 in mid-session on Nasadaq in 2007's first trading session.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-google-shares-idUSN0341569820070103</link><sectors><value><value>Tech, </value><value>Asian Markets</value></value></sectors><title>google ' s biggest bull sets $ 630 share price target</title></story></items>
