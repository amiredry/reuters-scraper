By contrast, the next move on U.S. interest rates is likely to be a cut from 5.25 percent after a steady policy in recent months.Japanese rates are seen rising at a very gradual pace from 0.25 percent, maintaining the euro's yield advantage.Official figures for December showed the number of unemployed people in Germany posted its sharpest monthly fall since 1950, pushing the jobless rate below 10 percent for the first time in over four years.The euro hit its highest level against the Swiss franc in almost seven years, but fell 0.4 percent against the dollar to $1.3223 EUR=, more than half a cent below three-week highs set in the previous session.FOMC MINUTES, U.S. DATA DUEMinutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest rate-setting meeting at 1900 GMT were seen casting light on current thinking for the U.S. rate outlook, with analysts widely expecting that the next move in borrowing costs will be a cut.Fed officials have been talking tough on inflation even as the market bet on rate cuts, and dollar bears will be looking for any hint of a softer tone.The Institute for Supply Management's December reading on the U.S. manufacturing sector is also due, while Friday brings the non-farm payrolls report for December.A reading below 50 in the ISM index, which dipped below the boom-or-bust level for the first time in three-and-a-half years in November, would reinforce concerns about an economic slowdown.The ISM is forecast to give a reading of 49.9.Other U.S. data due on Wednesday includes the ADP December employment report at 1315 GMT, often seen as a precursor to Friday's payrolls data.(Additional reporting by Simon Falush in London)</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-markets-forex-idUSN2941694320070103</link><sectors><value><value>Asian Markets</value></value></sectors><title>yen hits record low vs euro</title></story></items>
