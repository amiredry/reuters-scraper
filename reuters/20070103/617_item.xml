Irwin is seen puling the barb out before he begins to lose consciousness.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/04/us-australia-irwin-idUSSYD17523920070104</link><sectors><value><value>Entertainment, </value><value>People</value></value></sectors><title>steve irwin death film given to wife</title></story></items>
