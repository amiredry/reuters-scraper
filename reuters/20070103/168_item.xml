 Rating              Sell               Neutral    
 Price target        $25                $30 --Banc of America Securities said the carmaker's lower
first-half market share, despite a peak new product pipeline,
should get investors worried about a sharp fourth-quarter
decline in new product volume. --Also, GM's vehicle overpricing and inventory levels are
worse than the first quarter of 2005 and when the company last
missed earnings expectations, Banc of America added.
