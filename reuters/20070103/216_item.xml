As they were in the process of selling, I began thinking of writing a story based on the house and the garden and this feeling of things slipping away."</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-britain-author-death-idUSL0324831720070103</link><sectors><value><value>Entertainment, </value><value>People</value></value></sectors><title>tom ' s midnight garden author dies aged 86</title></story></items>
