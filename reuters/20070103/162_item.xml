RRD.N on Wednesday said it agreed to buy U.S. educational
textbook printer Von Hoffmann for $412.5 million in cash from
Visant Corp. The deal marks the third announced acquisition by R.R.
Donnelley in the past three months to boost its capacity and
flexibility for print customers. R.R. Donnelley, a commercial
printer based in Chicago, said the Von Hoffmann deal will add
to earnings in the first year. Last month, R.R. Donnelley said it would buy magazine and
catalog printer Perry Judd's Holdings Inc. for $176 million. In
October, it said it would pay $1.3 billion in cash for Banta
Corp. BN.N, which has about $1.5 billion in annual revenue. All three deals are set to close in the first quarter of
2007.   In the nine months ended Sept. 30, R.R. Donnelley reported
net sales of $6.85 billion, up from $6.04 billion in the
year-earlier period, and net earnings of $402 million, compared
to $300 million. The company's stock rose 3.89 percent in
2006. (Reporting by Nitya Rao in Bangalore and Tim McLaughlin in
