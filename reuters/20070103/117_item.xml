Nordic (BAVA.CO) said on Wednesday that its U.S. subsidiary BN
ImmunoTherapeutics received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) to start clinical trials with the breast
cancer vaccine MVA-BN-HER-2. Patient enrolment in a Phase I/II study in the United States
will start as soon as possible, Bavarian said. BN ImmunoTherapeutics also plans to start a Phase I/II study
with the vaccine in Europe. The two studies are expected to enroll up to 60 patients and
are designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the
vaccine. Its effect on the clinical progress of the patients and
on tumor growth will also be explored. To determine how best to incorporate the vaccine into
standard therapy, it will also be tested in combination with
traztuzumab (Herceptin) and chemotherapy. In Europe, the vaccine will also be tested in first-line
therapy of metastatic breast cancer, Bavarian said.
