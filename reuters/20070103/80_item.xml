The mela in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh made it to the Guinness Book of Records as the world's most popular pilgrimage in 1989, after drawing a crowd of 15 million.* Between 50 and 70 million pilgrims were estimated to have taken part in the Maha Kumbh Mela in 2001. Its numbers dwarf the world's other great religious pilgrimages, like the Haj, which drew some 2.5 million Muslims to Mecca this month.* The city of Allahabad is one of four sacred spots where Garuda, the winged steed of Hindu god Vishnu, is said to have rested while battling demons over a pitcher of divine nectar of immortality.* The Kumbh Mela generally rotates between Allahabad, and the other holy sites, Hardwar, Ujjain and Nasik, every three years. Allahabad's pilgrims wash at the confluence of two of India's most holy rivers, the Ganga and the Yamuna, and a third mythical underground river, the Saraswati.* Most religions practice ritual bathing for purification -- but not in such large crowds. As well as purifying themselves, pilgrims can take the "pavitra dubki", or "holy dip", in the name of friends and relatives who cannot travel to the mela themselves.Source: Reuters, Uttar Pradesh Tourism (www.up-tourism.com)</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-india-hindu-idUSSP16494020070103</link><sectors><value><value>World</value></value></sectors><title>factbox - five facts on hindu bathing festival</title></story></items>
