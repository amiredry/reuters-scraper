fourth-quarter earnings outlook, citing a projected tonnage
decline at its less-than truckload operating unit, among other
factors. The trucking and logistics company said it now expects
earnings from continuing operations of 72 cents to 76 cents a
share. Its previous earnings outlook was 81 cents to 87 cents a
share. The outlook excludes an expected gain from the sale of
Vector SCM LLC, the company's logistics joint venture with
General Motors Corp. (GM.N), Con-way said in a statement.
