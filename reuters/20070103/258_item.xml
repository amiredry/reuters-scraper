(AIRA.KL) is set to order 100 Airbus jetliners, increasing its 
existing order for single-aisle A320s, as it looks to expand 
its service in Southeast Asia, The Wall Street Journal reported 
on Wednesday, citing a person it said had knowledge of the 
decision. The order would be worth $6.7 billion based on list prices, 
the Journal said. It would mark a huge win for Airbus, 
majority-owned by European aerospace group EADS EAD.PA, 
against U.S. rival Boeing Co. (BA.N). The low-cost carrier 
expects to take delivery of the new planes starting in 2012, 
the Journal said. Earlier this year, AirAsia ordered 40 A320s and took 
options to buy an additional 30. An Airbus spokesman declined 
to comment on the report. A call to AirAsia was not immediately 
returned.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/businesspro-airasia-airbus-order-dc-idUSN0338841320070103</link><sectors></sectors><title>airasia to order more airbus a320s : report</title></story></items>
