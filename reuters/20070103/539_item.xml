Corinne Bailey Rae hopes to waltz through the door her soulful 
pop colleague Norah Jones kicked open in 2003, when she won 
five awards including best new artist and album of the year. Rae, whose self-titled debut was released internationally 
in February and in June Stateside, will compete on February 11 
for best new artist, as well as for record and song of the year 
for the irresistible "Put Your Records On." Although the track 
stalled at No. 64 on Billboard's flagship Hot 100 singles 
chart, it was a hit at various radio formats. The laid-back craftsmanship of Jones is a definite 
touchstone of Rae's sound, but the artist also dabbles in 
neo-soul and jazzy arrangements on her debut, which has sold a 
hefty 599,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen 
SoundScan. Sales have increased during six of the past seven 
weeks. And like Jones, Rae has appealed to a wide range of 
consumers right out of the gate, a fact she attributes to a 
shift in listening tastes. "I think music is going in two directions," she says. 
"People like a lot of popular music where songs don't mean 
much, but it's about hooks, production and little catchy 
things. Then there are people who also like listening to 
someone strumming a guitar and playing a song. I really admire 
both styles -- the Carole Kings of 'How does a song work?' and 
more like inventing a new style of production, like on (Snoop 
Dogg's) 'Drop It Like It's Hot.' "I really tried to stay away from what's happening in 
contemporary music and just listened a lot to the music I love, 
like Marvin Gaye, Al Green and Stevie Wonder, and thought of 
that as a benchmark," she explains. Rae has built her audience with extensive North American 
touring and numerous TV appearances, beginning with "The 
Tonight Show With Jay Leno" and "Good Morning America" in June 
and continuing through with mid-December performances on TNT's 
"Christmas in Washington" and CBS' "The Early Show." And, in a 
booking that proves Rae's own idols are embracing her music, 
she was chosen to perform alongside Wonder at his December 16 
House Full of Toys benefit in Los Angeles. Rae also recently 
taped an episode of "The Oprah Winfrey Show" with Mary J. Blige 
that will air January 16. "I haven't had a chance to really think about (how) anyone 
could get to hear" the album, she says. "Once you've made it 
and it's out there, it works for you, but it has its own life 
and legs and you never know who's going to get to hear it. 
That's been the amazing thing." Rae will return to the road in North America in late winter 
or early spring, according to her U.S. label Capitol, which is 
still weighing options for the next single from her album.
