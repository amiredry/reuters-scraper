has replaced eBay Inc. (EBAY.O) on its select list. In a research note, the brokerage said it expects the
Internet search company to generate $5.5 billion of net profit
in 2008 or about $300 million more than the equivalent taxed
net profit of Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN.O), eBay Inc., Expedia Inc.
(EXPE.O), IAC/InterActiveCorp. (IACI.O) and Yahoo Inc.
(YHOO.O), combined. The brokerage added that Google stands best positioned to
benefit given its competitive position as both traffic
aggregator and distributor. Stifel has a price target of $554 on the stock.
