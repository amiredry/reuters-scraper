Engineering Co. Ltd. (042660.KS) aims to win orders worth $11
billion in 2007, unchanged from last year, the world's
second-largest shipbuilder said on Wednesday. That compared to a forecast 5 percent fall in orders this
year from its bigger rival Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd.
(009540.KS). "The target, which is similar to last year, shows our
intention to secure necessary orders in order to meet a mid-term
vision," Nam Sang-tae, Daewoo's CEO and President said in a
statement, referring the company's goal to post sales of 15
trillion won ($16.20 billion) by 2011. Daewoo did not provide sales and profit forecasts, but a
company official said sales in 2007 were expected to be much
higher than last year, helped by a rise in ship prices. Analysts expect Daewoo's sales this year to rise 23.3
percent to 6.57 trillion won from 2006's forecast of 5.33
trillion. according to Reuters Estimates. South Korean shipbuilders are seen benefiting from lucrative
orders for high value ships despite the strengthening of the won
currency KRW=, analysts said. Daewoo's net profit in 2007 is expected to more than triple
to 438.9 billion won from an estimate of 122.3 billion last
year, according to Reuters Estimates. Shares in Daewoo closed 0.17 percent lower at 29,650 won,
compared to a 1.81 pct fall in Seoul's main index .KS11..
