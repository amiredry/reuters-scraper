bought a whopping C$3.3 billion ($2.8 billion) worth of mutual
funds in December, according to preliminary data released on
Wednesday, the highest net sales figure for a December since
1996. The Investment Funds Institute of Canada (IFIC) said total
net sales for the whole of 2006 were around C$21 billion, down
from 2005's C$22.6 billion. "But sales in November and December 2006 -- the traditional
start of the RRSP season -- outpaced the same two months in
2005," said Susan Yellin, IFIC's communications director. A registered retirement savings plan, or RRSP, is a
national, tax-advantaged investment plan. RRSP season refers to
the period when fund sellers step up campaigns to lure buyers
ahead of the end of the tax year so they can make use of the
tax break in that year. In November, Canadians snapped up C$2.6 billion of mutual
funds, with global equity and balanced funds hot sellers. IFIC also estimates that the mutual fund industry had net
assets of between C$657 billion and C$662 billion at the end of
December, up about 2.2 percent on the month before. ($1=$1.17 Canadian)
