(AMGN.O) formed an alliance with Cytokinetics (CYTK.O) to gain an
option on an experimental drug to treat heart failure, The New
York Times reported on Wednesday. Under the terms of the agreement, which could be announced
Wednesday morning, Amgen will pay Cytokinetics $75 million for
the option on the drug, which is about to enter the second of
three stages of clinical trials, the Times said. The payment would comprise $42 million in cash and the
purchase of $33 million in Cytokinetics stock, giving Amgen
about 7 percent of the smaller company, the paper added. Amgen
would pay $9.47 a share, a 27-percent premium to Cytokinetics'
closing price on Friday, the paper said. Cytokinetics could eventually get additional payments of
more than $600 million, plus royalties, if the drug reaches the
market and has significant sales, the paper also reported. Officials from both companies were not immediately
available for comment.
