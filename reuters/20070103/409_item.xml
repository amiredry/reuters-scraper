It will compete with a plethora of online rivals, including popular Web sites Zappos.com, Onlineshoes.com and Shoes.com, which all offer free standard shipping and returns.Amazon's new site offers free overnight shipping and return shipping.In November, brick-and-mortar retailer Gap Inc. launched its own online shoe venture, Piperlime.com.Sales growth in accessories, including footwear, well exceeds apparel growth rates, said C.L. King analyst Scott Krasik.Driving growth has been the popularity of boots as well as the proliferation of "it bags," luxury handbags that are photographed on celebrities and circulated in magazines."People were scared for a long time that people wouldn't buy shoes online because of fit," Krasik said. "The model is proven that it works. Zappos has proven that."Also contributing to the wave of online shoe and accessories Web sites is the fact that most brands don't have significant retail Web sites, he added.An Amazon spokeswoman said that the company will continue to feature the same shoes and bags on its main Web site.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-amazon-idUSN0341910820070103</link><sectors><value><value>Tech</value></value></sectors><title>amazon launches shoe and handbag web site</title></story></items>
