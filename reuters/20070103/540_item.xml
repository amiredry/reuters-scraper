the Week comes from an appropriately cool place: Solna, Sweden. The Nomads have been leading the contemporary garage rock 
movement in Sweden since 1980 -- a virtual Nordic Chesterfield 
Kings, if you will. Original members Nick Vahlberg (vocals) and Hans Ustland 
(guitar) have changed rhythm sections through the years, but as 
their new compilation "Nomadic Dementia: The Best of the First 
25 Years" suggests, they've been consistently great from the 
jump. Elsewhere, Bob Dylan's chart-topping "Modern Times" was one 
of the few classic rock albums to go gold last year, and should 
have been a lock for the album of the year Grammy. And it wasn't even nominated. So that makes it unanimous: Anybody doing great business 
live is officially banished from the mainstream music business 
forever. One thing's for sure, though. The classic rock generation 
can be proud of the fact that Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Neil 
Young, Ray Davies and Pete Townshend continue to be 
artistically adventurous, in spite of a mainstream radio world 
that obviously isn't interested, and all produced 
uncompromisingly brilliant work in 2006. That takes strength 
and courage and refusal to go gently into their good night. So now, boys, it's time to come back with follow-up 
Exterminator Pop Rock albums, 12 three-minute killer songs, 
just to show these young whippersnappers how it's really done. See you on the radio. (Musician and actor Steven Van Zandt, a founding member of 
Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, is host of the syndicated 
radio program Little Steven's Undergound Garage.) Reuters/Billboard</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/music-garage-dc-idUSN0326707620070103</link><sectors><value><value>Music</value></value></sectors><title>all hail sweden ' s nomads , classic rockers</title></story></items>
