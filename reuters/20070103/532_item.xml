Paulson on Wednesday endorsed a White House plan to balance the
budget by 2012, saying it could be accomplished with low taxes,
strong job and productivity growth and restrained spending. In a statement issued nearly seven hours after President
George W. Bush announced he would submit the five-year budget
proposal to Congress, Paulson said Bush's 2003 tax cuts laid
the foundation for sustained economic growth and job creation. "A strong economy means higher revenues to the Treasury. If
we can keep our economy growing by continuing with economic
policies that keep taxes low and drive job creation and
productivity, while restraining spending, we can achieve a
balanced budget by 2012," Paulson said. Bush said the budget he submits to Congress will aim to
make lower tax rates permanent. He also said entitlement
programs for retired Americans and for medical care need reform
"so future generations of Americans can benefit from these
vital programs without bankrupting our economy."
