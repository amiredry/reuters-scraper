(SPPI.O) said on Wednesday that U.S. regulators have signed off
on the company's proposed design of a mid-stage trial of its
experimental drug to treat enlargement of the prostate. The company said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
approved a proposed Phase IIb study -- scheduled to begin this
month -- of about 100 patients. Spectrum said it is on track to initiate Phase III, or
late-stage trials, of the drug -- ozarelix -- in the second
half of this year. The drug is designed to treat benign prostatic hypertrophy,
a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate often occurring in
men over the age of 50. It affects more than 50 percent of men
over the age of 60, the company said, citing the National
Institutes of Health.
