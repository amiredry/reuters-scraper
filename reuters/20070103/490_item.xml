the average U.S. wholesale prices of its drugs by more than 5
percent, according to industry analysts, despite increased
political scrutiny of the cost of prescription medicines. Bear Stearns analyst John Boris said in a research note that
Pfizer on Jan. 1 had raised prices of its drugs by an average of
5.2 percent, somewhat more aggressive than price increases taken
in each of the previous three years. Increases of 5 percent were seen for cholesterol fighter
Lipitor, the world's top-selling medicine, as well as for
arthritis treatment Celebrex. But Boris said no mark-ups were seen
for Chantix and Exubera, recently introduced drugs to help smokers
quit and to treat diabetes. "We would have guessed that Pfizer would raise list prices a
bit less given anticipated political pricing scrutiny in 2007,"
said Merrill Lynch analyst David Risinger, who estimated Pfizer
had raised its U.S. average wholesale prices by 5.6 percent. Pfizer may have needed to raise prices sharply to make good on
its prediction that 2007 revenue will match that seen last year,
Risinger said in his research note. The company's once-stellar
sales growth has come to a halt largely due to generic competition
for a number of its products. Pfizer spokesman Paul Fitzhenry said the company, which
estimates prices on a different basis called wholesaler
acquisition costs, had raised prices by 4.7 percent, after taking
into consideration discounts Pfizer offers to some customers on
the same drugs. "This is (only) one component of our revenue performance," he
said, referring to the price increases.
