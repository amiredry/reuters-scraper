<items><story><date>08:16 03 January 2007 (UTC)</date><text> (Adds details) Jan 3 Wachovia Capital Markets downgraded auto
supplier Lear Corp. (LEA.N) to "underperform" from "market
perform", as its launch tempo begins to weaken on vehicle
production volatility of large pickup trucks, SUV's and
minivans. The brokerage believes that the re-acceleration of price
pressures at Tier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers will mute margin
expansion coming from lower launch costs and new product
launches. The brokerage downgraded Magna International Inc. (MGA.N)
MGa.TO, also an auto supplier, to "market perform" from
"outperform", noting that the company's North American SUV,
minivan and pickup exposure will continue to press margins in
the near-term. Wachovia also downgraded auto retailers Lithia Motors Inc.
(LAD.N) and AutoNation Inc. (AN.N) to "market perform" from
outperform". Wachovia expects brand mix to continue to hurt AutoNation,
and that its recent performance in used vehicles and parts and
service has been disappointing relative to the competition. For Lithia Motors, the brokerage said it thinks upside to
the stock hinges on meaningful shift in mix back to traditional
light trucks, which Wachovia does not see happening in 2007. In addition, Wachovia said other efforts at Lithia such as
used vehicle inventory management and consolidation of
administrative functions won't have a positive effect on
operating margins until 2008.
