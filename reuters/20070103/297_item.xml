rose 6.4 percent in 2006, at the top end of the government's
forecast range of 4.5 percent to 6.5 percent, the National
Statistics Institute said on Wednesday. The 2006 figure was largely driven by an increase in food
and beverage costs and private health care prices, the
government said. In 2005, consumer price inflation in the South American
country was 4.9 percent, below market expectations. December inflation was 0.37 percent versus 0.2 percent in
the same period last year. Following a crippling economic crisis in 2002, Uruguay's
economy has expanded rapidly over the past four years. Gross
domestic product grew 7 percent in the first nine months of
2006 compared with the same period last year, driven by a
strong manufacturing sector. The farm sector is the main driver of the economy, with
strong demand for beef exports and agro-industrial products.
