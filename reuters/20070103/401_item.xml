exchanges Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. CME.N and CBOT
Holdings Inc. BOT.N to "outperform" from "marketperform." The recent retrenchment in shares of Chicago Mercantile and
CBOT Holdings may relate to possible anti-trust concerns
regarding their proposed combination, but the management is

and $570 on Chicago Mercantile.
