Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga did not elaborate on the reasons for his departure but told a news conference it was "not a money decision".Huizenga said he was Saban's "biggest fan," even though Miami failed to reach the playoffs during his reign."I'll be cheering for him," Huizenga said of his former coach's new job with the Crimson Tide. "I like Nick a lot and I think he could have won here."Saban's contract with Alabama is for eight years, according to media reports.Coaching Alabama is one of the marquee jobs in college football although the Crimson Tide lost to Oklahoma State in the Independence Bowl last week to finish the season with a 6-7 record.Saban won the national title with Louisiana State in 2003. He was 9-7 in his first year with the Dolphins but slumped to 6-10 this season, his first losing campaign as a head coach.The former Toledo and Michigan State coach replaces the fired Mike Shula at Alabama.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-nfl-dolphins-idUSL0308031020070103</link><sectors><value><value>U.S., </value><value>Sports</value></value></sectors><title>dolphins coach saban leaves for alabama</title></story></items>
