EAGL.O jumped more than 26 percent in early trading, a day after Chief Executive James Crane and private equity firm General Atlantic LLC offered to buy the company for $36 per share in cash.EGL shares were trading up $7.83 at $37.61 in early Nasdaq trading.Crane, who is EGL's largest shareholder, said on Tuesday he would continue as chairman and CEO of the Houston-based company, which handles air and ocean freight forwarding and local delivery services.EGL's board has formed a special committee of independent directors to review the offer.The board is likely to view the deal favorably, BB&amp;T Capital Markets analyst John Barnes said in a research note."We doubt seriously that another buyer of EAGL will emerge, particularly considering that Crane, who owns 18 percent of the outstanding stock, is involved in the current proposed transaction," Barnes wrote, adding that further private equity buyout deals in the transportation sector were likely.(Reporting by Nick Zieminski, Reuters Messaging rm://nick.zieminski.reuters.com@reuters.net Email: nick.zieminski@reuters.com Phone: 1-646-223-6162))</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-egl-shares-idUSN0339462320070103</link><sectors><value><value>Asian Markets</value></value></sectors><title>egl shares jump over 26 percent on buyout offer</title></story></items>
