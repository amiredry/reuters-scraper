Wednesday said its U.S. December sales fell 9.6 percent from a
year earlier, driven by a decline in truck sales. The world's largest automaker sold 341,327 vehicles in the
United States last month, compared with 392,041 vehicles a year
earlier. GM lowered its first-quarter 2007 production forecast to
1.120 million vehicles -- 455,000 cars and 665,000 trucks --
down 20,000 vehicles from its previous target announced last
month. The majority of the production decrease is attributed to
GM's efforts to reduce low-margin daily rental fleet sales, the
company said.
