to help Xstrata Plc XTA.L and the union at its Sudbury,
Ontario, nickel operations negotiate a new labor contract. The company requested a mediator "a while back," as the
last three collective agreements have involved disputes, said
Rick Grylls, a Canadian Auto Workers union spokesman. The current contract, which covers more than 1,000
employees who work in the mines, mills and smelters in Sudbury,
expires on Jan. 31. The sides exchanged initial proposals in mid-December and
have been negotiating ever since. Currently, talks are centered
on contract language and are taking place Monday to Friday. The union is looking for improvements to wages, pensions
and benefits as the price of nickel has been at record highs
amid strong demand and low supplies. This is the first set of talks in Sudbury for Swiss-based
Xstrata, which took over Canada's Falconbridge and its copper
and nickel assets in August 2006. The newly named Xstrata Nickel produced 19,708 tonnes of
nickel from its Sudbury operations in 2005. A strike authorization vote is set for Jan. 16.
