(HD.N) made him, and the retailer, a favorite target of shareholder activists. Now, his exit package is giving critics a new round of ammunition.Nardelli stepped down from his job as chairman and chief executive on Wednesday, walking away with about $210 million in a severance deal -- the equivalent of about $96,000 for every day of his 6-year tenure.The payout comes on top of earnings of at least $119.2 million in salary and bonus, not including options, that Nardelli, 58, collected as CEO through the end of fiscal 2006.All the while, Home Depot shares lost nearly 8 percent of their value during Nardelli's tenure."He should be giving money back, not taking more money out," said Nell Minow, co-founder of The Corporate Library, a research group that rates companies' governance practices. "Performance has been poor and he has been hugely overpaid every step of the way."Investor activists have a long list of complaints over how Home Depot is run -- and they say the board should have cut a much less generous exit deal with Nardelli.The Atlanta-based company has been under pressure amid weakening sales and profits and it faces a regulatory probe into its stock options award practices. It drew particular wrath last year when board members skipped the 2006 annual meeting amid criticism of Nardelli's compensation."The golden parachute he's been given is not acceptable to shareholders," said Richard Ferlauto, director or pension and benefit policy at the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees, a union umbrella group that has been critical of executive compensation.The AFL-CIO on Wednesday called on Home Depot to freeze all payments to Nardelli until the company can determine whether the compensation pact was properly entered into and whether the former CEO "complied with his obligations under those agreements."The union group also called for the resignation of lead director Kenneth Langone, who was sued by the New York attorney general's office over the pay package of former New York Stock Exchange chairman Richard Grasso in a separate case. The group said it also wants further disclosure from the company about the findings of an internal probe into the timing of stock options awards.Janna Sampson, a fund manager at OakBrook Investments outside Chicago that holds about 513,000 Home Depot shares, said the board likely had little choice but to give Nardelli the large payout -- as his severance terms were outlined in his employment agreement.The company is paying a "pretty steep price" to get rid of Nardelli, she said. But Home Depot "may be trying to remove what had become kind of a block to moving forward."Some politicians were quick to weigh in on the exit package. Nardelli's severance is "further confirmation of the need to deal with a pattern of CEO pay that appears to be out of control," said U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.MONEY, MONEY, MONEYHome Depot isn't the only company that's come under criticism recently for payouts to outgoing chiefs.Ex-Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) CEO Hank McKinnell, who was replaced following a steep decline in the company's market value, will get about $198 million upon his departure.Meanwhile, shareholder watchdogs say they are awaiting details of how much the new Home Depot chief, 57-year-old Vice Chairman Frank Blake, will be paid. Both Nardelli and Blake were formerly executives at General Electric Co. (GE.N)."My guess is the pay package (for Blake) is not going to be high profile -- his package will probably be more run of the mill," said Joseph Carcello, director of research at the University of Tennessee's Corporate Governance Center.The company's board, he said, has been shown that "you need to align the compensation more closely with the returns to stockholders."But Minow, of the Corporate Library, which gives Home Depot an "F" grade for overall governance practices, says that it won't be clear if the board has learned its lessons until the specifics of the new CEO's pay package are released."We will get a chance to see if they have learned from their mistakes," she said. "Based on this departure package, it looks like they haven't."(Additional reporting by Joseph Giannone)</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/04/us-homedepot-nardelli-exitpackage-idUSN0340057220070104</link><sectors></sectors><title>home depot still needs to learn lessons , critics say</title></story></items>
