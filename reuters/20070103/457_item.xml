Administration has warned medical device maker Viasys
Healthcare Inc. VAS.N over its failure to implement certain
review procedures for its air pressure devices, according to a
letter released on Wednesday. The agency had earlier warned the company about its lack of
procedures to review the devices, made by the company's Tiara
Medical Systems unit, the Dec. 12 letter said. Viasys had responded to the FDA, but the agency said it
still had some concerns. The FDA added it will conduct a
follow-up inspection.
