I still have a persistent cough," he told reporters."The last four days I have not been feeling that well. But it was good to have a fast match today, I am very happy with that."Baghdatis toyed with Ramirez Hidalgo in a one-sided match with the Spaniard."It feels great to be in the quarter-finals of the first tournament of the new season," Baghdatis said."I'm moving very well and my serving is good. I'm really looking forward to the Australian Open later this month," added last year's Melbourne runner-up.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-tennis-men-qatar-idUSL0308194720070103</link><sectors><value><value>Sports</value></value></sectors><title>top seed davydenko powers into qatar quarters</title></story></items>
