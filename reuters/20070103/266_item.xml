changed in early trading on Wednesday as tumbling copper prices
hit miner Grupo Mexico, while America Movil, the dominant
mobile-phone company, gained. The benchmark IPC stock index .MXX fell 0.01 percent to
26,660 points, while the peso currency MXN= MEX01 firmed
0.14 percent to 10.7600 per dollar. Shares for Grupo Mexico (GMEXICOB.MX), a major copper
producer, shed 2.33 percent to 38.62 pesos. Copper prices in
London slumped to their lowest since April of last year as
rising stockpiles fueled worries of a surplus. Cemex (CMXCPO.MX), the world's third-largest producer of
cement, fell 0.89 percent to 36.87 pesos, while its New York
traded shares (CX.N) were up 0.97 percent to $34.21. America Movil (AMXL.MX), one of Latin America's most
closely watched stocks, was the leading gainer, rising 1.22
percent to 24.95 pesos. Its New York traded shares (AMX.N) rose
2.72 percent to $46.45, while its holding company, America
Telecom AMTELA1.MX, rose 0.84 percent to 100.60 pesos.  TV Azteca TVAZTCACPO.MX, Mexico's second-largest
television network, rose 1.88 percent to 8.68 pesos. The IPC index rose nearly 49 percent in 2006 on strong
corporate profits and a sharp drop in Mexico's country risk.
Many analysts expect the trend to continue this year, though at
a slower pace.
