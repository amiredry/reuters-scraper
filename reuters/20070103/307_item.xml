edged lower on Wednesday as a report showing a slight rebound
in manufacturing activity last month countered signs of a
weakening economy after data that business payrolls
unexpectedly fell. Bonds slipped modestly after the Institute for Supply
Management's reading of industrial activity in December showed
an unexpected rise, defying market predictions for a second
month of modest contraction. That prompted investors to scale
back already limited expectations for a cut of U.S. benchmark
interest rates in the first quarter. Ahead of the ISM data, bond prices had climbed after the
ADP National Employment Report showed private sector employers
shed 40,000 jobs last month. That contrasted sharply with
market forecasts for an increase of 128,000 and represented the
first contraction in private sector employment in nearly four
years. "We are still not getting a consistent story from the
numbers and this leads to more questions than answers on where
(the economy is) headed next," said Mario DeRose, fixed-income
strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, Missouri. "The Treasury market seems somewhat confused also and is
unsure of which way to go. I don't see a lot of conviction out
there right now," DeRose added. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR traded down 1/32 in
price for a yield of 4.69 percent, versus 4.64 percent before
the ISM report and versus 4.68 percent late on Tuesday. Bond
yields and prices move inversely. The Institute for Supply Management's December
manufacturing report reading was 51.4, above the 50 mark that
divides expansion from contraction; it was above economists'
forecasts for 49.9, and up from November's 49.5 reading. Earlier data showed that U.S. private sector employment
likely declined by 40,000 in December, the first contraction
since April 2003, according to the ADP National Employment
Report. "Clearly, going into the employment data this Friday,
people coming into the New Year with a clean book would
certainly feel that this (the ADP report) is something people
want to be buying bonds on," said Michael Cheah, vice
president and portfolio manager with AIG SunAmerica Asset
Management in Jersey City. Economists' median forecast for non-farm payrolls, due on
Friday, has been for a rise of 110,000 jobs in the overall
economy in December, but after the ADP report some Wall Street
analysts pared back their forecasts for payrolls. Two-year notes US2YT=RR, which respond closely to
expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate moves, traded
unchanged in price for a yield of 4.80 percent, compared with
4.80 percent on Tuesday. Bond investors were also turning their sights to minutes
from the Federal Reserve's December policy-setting meeting,
due at 2 p.m. (1900 GMT) for clues to how the Fed viewed trends
in the economy in early December. Thirty-year bonds traded down 3/32 in price for a yield of
4.79 percent US30YT=RR.
