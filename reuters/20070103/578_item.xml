Chrysler Group will offer consumer incentives of up to $5,000
on some 2007 Dodge Ram light duty pickup trucks through January
to maintain sales momentum, executives said on Wednesday. Chrysler will also offer low-rate financing and consumer
cash incentives of $1,000 to $1,500 on some vehicles including
the Charger and Chrysler 300, executives said in a conference
call with analysts and reporters. Executives also said Chrysler reduced the number of
unassigned vehicles in inventory to below 10,000 at the end of
December, exceeding a target to cut the "sales bank" to the low
five-digits. It had swelled to 100,000 at one point in 2006. Chrysler Group, which includes the Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep
brands, said U.S. sales rose 1 percent in December. The results
were supported by incentives offered to reduce inventories,
analysts said. In December, Chrysler Group spent $4,400 on incentives per
vehicle, their highest level ever, mainly to get rid of excess
2006 inventory, including more than $6,400 per large truck,
said Alex Rosten, an industry analyst with Edmunds.com. Chrysler Group ended 2006 with inventory of 538,000
vehicles, a 74-day supply, down about 10 percent from the end
of 2005, meeting a target to reach the low- to mid-500,000
range by the end of the year, it said.
