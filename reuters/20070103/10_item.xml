Advanced Medical Optics Inc. EYE.N  said on Wednesday
requests by U.S. health regulators could delay the launch of
its Tecnis multifocal lens by 12 to 18 months. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration had recommended the
company enroll additional subjects in its U.S. clinical study
for the Tecnis intraocular lens. Advanced Medical Optics said it still plans to file a
premarket approval application next month according to its
original plan to launch the lens in the United States in the
first half of 2008. At the same time, the FDA requests create "a reasonable
likelihood the launch timeline could be extended by
approximately 12-18 months," the company said.
