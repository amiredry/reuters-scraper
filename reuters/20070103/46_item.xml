But the bureau said remnants of the cyclone will join an inland storm, creating a new destructive storm late on Wednesday or Thursday over Australia's major goldfields in the south of Western Australia."We're expecting some quite exceptional winds on Thursday, perhaps reaching 100 to 120 km per hour, so there'll be localized damaging winds and the risk of quite significant livestock losses with the combination of rain and wind producing hypothermia," said the bureau's Elliott.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-australia-cyclone-idUSSYD15727220070103</link><sectors><value><value>World, </value><value>Science</value></value></sectors><title>perfect storm brews over australia ' s west</title></story></items>
