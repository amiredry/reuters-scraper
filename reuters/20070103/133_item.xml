holiday sales this week as retailers release December sales 
figures amid concerns heavy promotions used to lure customers 
will cut into profits. Most U.S. retailers report December sales on Thursday, 
while electronics retailers Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY.N) and 
Circuit City Stores Inc. CC.N weigh in with their sales on 
Friday. Industry leader Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT.N) has already 
said its sales rose 1.6 percent in December at U.S. stores open 
at least a year, according to preliminary data, beating its own 
forecast of flat to up 1 percent. "We believe Wal-Mart managed to deliver its above plan 1.6 
percent comp (comparable-store sales) because of an extra 
selling day, an easy after Christmas week comparison, and 
aggressive promotions as the season winded down," wrote Goldman 
Sachs analyst Adrianne Shapira in a note. But she said the "above plan" sales for the retailer, which 
aggressively promoted lower prices on electronics and toys, 
were likely driven by "above plan" markdowns, which does not 
bode well for fourth-quarter earnings. The impact of markdowns will also be closely monitored in 
the sales reports this week. "Everyone is going to be looking to see if there's any 
mention within that news release of any change in earnings 
guidance, or anything in the language of the description of 
what occurred that can point toward and suggest earnings 
direction for Q4," said Bernard Sands retail analyst Richard 
Hastings. "Q4 earnings is a big question mark and it looks like it's 
not going to be a very good quarter for a lot of retailers."
 BATTLING ELECTRONICS Retail Metrics LLC, with an index of 57 retailers, expects 
December same-store sales to rise 3.3 percent, compared with a 
3.4 percent increase a year ago. Excluding Wal-Mart, the index forecasts a 4.6 percent gain 
in December same-store sales, and a 3.5 percent gain excluding 
Wal-Mart and drug store chains. The index does not include Best 
Buy or Circuit City. Electronics were brisk sellers this holiday season as 
prices for flat-panel televisions plunged and retailers heavily 
promoted TVs, digital cameras, laptop computers and MP3 players 
to draw shoppers into their stores. Consumer technology retail sales from the week of Black 
Friday -- the day after Thanksgiving -- through the week ended 
December 23 were $8.75 billion -- up 6.5 percent from a year 
ago, according to NPD Group. But this year's gain trailed last 
year's 10 percent revenue rise due in part to the falling 
prices for flat-panel TVs, the market research firm said. While promotions -- which featured 42-inch plasma TVs 
selling for under $1,000 during the Thanksgiving shopping 
weekend -- drove sales, Best Buy and Circuit City have already 
said it hurt their profits for the third-quarter, which ended 
in November. The demand for the expensive advanced TVs could also mean 
difficult results for apparel retailers if shoppers decided 
against buying that extra sweater or scarf after shelling out 
hundreds or thousands of dollars for a TV. Wall Street is also watching to see how retailers dealt 
with procrastinators. Shoppers visited stores in droves during the November 
Thanksgiving shopping weekend, but then paused and waited for 
retailers to roll out last-minute deals in December before they 
finished their holiday shopping. "We definitely know that the first half of the month was 
slow," said Dana Telsey, founder of research firm Telsey 
Advisory Group. She said the question is: "What was the pick-up in the 
second half of the month and how much did the last week add?" Christmas fell on a Monday this year, giving shoppers a 
final weekend to shop ahead of the holiday. Retailers also faced unfavorable weather conditions in 
December. Shapira said the Goldman Sachs Rain or Shine 
Indicator showed the weather was 21 percent warmer this 
December compared with a year ago. "Getting into the holiday spirit was tough when there was 
no hint of winter in the air. Those retailers waiting for 
weather to break had a nail biter of a month," she wrote.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/businesspro-retail-sales-outlook-dc-idUSN0232286620070103</link><sectors><value><value>Markets</value></value></sectors><title>divining fourth - quarter earnings from december sales</title></story></items>
