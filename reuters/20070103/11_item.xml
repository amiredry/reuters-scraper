chasing down the Holy Grail in "Indiana Jones and the Last 
Crusade," Harrison Ford will return to the big screen in the 
character of the globe-trotting archeologist in May 2008. Producer George Lucas and director Steven Spielberg 
confirmed details of the project Monday after Lucas tipped off 
the media to Indiana Jones' imminent return as he prepared to 
serve as grand marshal of the Rose Parade in Pasadena. After years spent in script development, a fourth 
installment of the hit franchise is set to begin production in 
June in locations around the world and in the United States. It 
will mark Spielberg's next directorial outing. "George, Harrison and I are all very excited," Spielberg 
said. "We feel that the script was well worth the wait. We hope 
it delivers everything you'd expect from our history with 
Indiana Jones." In a statement, 64-year-old Ford said he was ready for 
another action-packed turn. "I'm delighted to be back in 
business with my old friends," he said. "I don't know if the 
pants still fit, but I know the hat will." Added Lucas: "These films are such great fun to make. I'm 
looking forward to reuniting with the team and starting this 
new journey." For the moment, the title of the new film as well as its 
story line are being kept under wraps. The film will be produced by Lucasfilm Ltd. and released 
worldwide by Paramount Pictures, the parent company of 
DreamWorks, which Spielberg co-founded. David Koepp, who has penned such previous Spielberg 
projects as "Jurassic Park" and "War of the Worlds," wrote the 
screenplay that finally got the stamp of approval from Lucas 
and Spielberg. An earlier screenplay by Frank Darabont was 
shelved when Lucas turned thumbs down on it. Although a spokesman for Spielberg said Monday that no 
casting has begun, Lucas and Ford have said that they would 
like to include Sean Connery, who played Indiana Jones' father, 
Professor Henry Jones, in "The Last Crusade." "We are writing 
him in whether he wants to do it or not," Lucas told "Access 
Hollywood" when Connery was honored in June with the American 
Film Institute's Life Achievement Award. It also is not known whether the project will be shot 
digitally, like Lucas' recent "Star Wars" movies, or on film, 
the medium Spielberg prefers. "Raiders of the Lost Ark," the first film in the series, 
was released in 1981, followed by "Indiana Jones and the Temple 
of Doom" in 1984 and "Last Crusade" in 1989. The three movies 
have earned 14 Academy Award nominations, seven Oscars and 
grossed more than $1.182 billion worldwide. A release date was not announced, but the past two films in 
the series opened shortly before the Memorial Day weekend. 
Currently, the May 2008 lineup includes Paramount's Marvel 
adaptation "Iron Man"; Disney's "The Chronicles of Narnia: 
Prince Caspian"; and Warner Bros. Pictures' "Speed Racer."
