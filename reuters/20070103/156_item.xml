rallied on Wednesday after a surprise contraction in private
sector jobs in December reported by private employment service
ADP. That hinted the non-farm payrolls report for December, due
on Friday, might prove soft, although economists debate the
extent of correlation between the two reports. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR rose 9/32 in price for
a yield of 4.65 percent, versus 4.67 percent just before the
data and versus 4.68 percent late on Tuesday. Bond yields and
prices move inversely.
