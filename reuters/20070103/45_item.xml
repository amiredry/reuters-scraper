investment vehicle of Sweden's Wallenberg family, has rejected a
bid approach for lawn mower and chain saw maker Husqvarna
(HUSQb.ST), newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported on Wednesday. Investor, which has made headlines in recent months with its
fight against German MAN's (MANG.DE) hostile bid for truck maker
Scania SCVb.ST, is Husqvarna's biggest owner with a stake
equal to 29.2 percent of voting rights and 11.1 percent of
capital as of November 30. "The approach from a large, European firm in the venture
capital sector was turned down by Investor," the Swedish
newspaper said, citing sources which it did not identify. The newspaper did not name the venture capital firm nor say
when the approach had been made and an Investor spokesman told
the paper it would not comment on the report. Husqvarna, which unveiled a 730 million euro ($969.4
million) deal to buy German sprinkler and garden hose maker
Gardena last month, was spun off and separately listed by home
appliances giant Electrolux (ELUXb.ST) in June last year.
