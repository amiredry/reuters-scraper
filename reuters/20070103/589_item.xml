Ltd. AGK.AX said on Thursday it has made a preliminary merger 
approach to Origin Energy Ltd. (ORG.AX). AGL said in a statement that the merger approach was based 
on a "nil premium scrip" basis, which means neither party would 
pay a share price premium to gain control of the combined 
company. Shares in Origin, which have risen 10.5 percent in the past 
month, closed at A$8.57 on Wednesday, while AGL's shares closed 
29 Australian cents lower at A$15.84. ($1=1.26 Australian Dollar)</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/04/businesspro-origin-agl-approach-dc-idUSSYU00144720070104</link><sectors></sectors><title>agl says has made merger approach to origin</title></story></items>
