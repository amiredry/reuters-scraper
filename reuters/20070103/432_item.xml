Wednesday after hitting a string of record highs, and the local
currency weakened after the central bank bought dollars to
build up reserves. The Bovespa .BVSP index of the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange
ended 2.07 percent lower at 44,445 points. It surpassed 45,000 points for the first time on Tuesday
after gaining 33 percent in 2006 and ending the year at its
highest finish ever. The real BRBY settled 0.37 percent weaker against the
U.S. dollar at 2.140. Buying of dollars by the central bank in
most daily sessions has weakened the real and boosted Brazil's
foreign reserves to about $86 billion, a historic high. Traders said the bank bought heavily on Tuesday and made
additional purchases Wednesday, easily moving the exchange rate
in quiet post-holiday trade. "The market still isn't operating at full steam, it's slow.
All the players aren't back so any little increase in demand
ends up moving the market a bit," said Daniel Szikszay, foreign
exchange director for Banco Schahin. In the stock market, prices slipped early and later tumbled
after the U.S. Federal Reserve published minutes from its
latest meeting that stirred up doubts on Wall Street about the
future strength of U.S. growth. Lower commodities prices added pressure on bellwether
stocks such as oil-driller Petrobras (PETR4.SA), which fell
3.47 percent to end at 48.70 reais. Iron ore miner Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (RIO.N)(VALE5.SA)
ended 4.16 percent lower at 53.00 reais.
