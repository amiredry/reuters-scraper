He is also charged with one count of offering an indignity to a dead body.Police said it was Svekla who reported the discovery of Quinney's body.Svekla was charged in May with the murder of another prostitute, whose body was found by police in a home near Edmonton.Royal Canadian Mounted Police allege Svekla now fits their definition of a serial killer -- someone who kills twice or more, but with a time lag between the murders."He does fall within the definition," said Corporal Wayne Oakes, an RCMP spokesman.Svekla is so far the only person to face any charges stemming from the death or disappearance of 25 sex trade workers in the region since 1975. The arrest was made by a 50-member investigating task force called Project Kare.The charge comes just days before the start of the trial of a Vancouver-area man police allege to be Canada's most prolific serial killer.Arguments are scheduled to begin on January 22, in the first of two scheduled trials for Robert "Willie" Pickton, who is charged with murdering 26 of more than 60 prostitutes and drug addicts who disappeared from Vancouver, British Columbia, from the late 1980s to late 2001.Police say they discovered the DNA of more than 30 of the missing women on Pickton's small, ramshackle pig farm in the Vancouver suburb of Port Coquitlam, but he has denied any connection with the women's disappearances or deaths.The first trial will be for six of the murder charges laid against Pickton.Svekla's lawyer could not be reached for comment.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-serialkillings-idUSN0342180320070103</link><sectors><value><value>World</value></value></sectors><title>man charged in second prostitute killing</title></story></items>
