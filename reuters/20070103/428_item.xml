Representatives will pass legislation this year that will
create a new regulatory regime for mortgage finance companies
Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N, the incoming leader
of the House Financial Services Committee said on Wednesday. "We will pass a bill," Rep. Barney Frank told reporters
after a speech at the National Press Club. "(It) will
substantially increase the ability of the regulators to oversee
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That has never been in question." The House passed a bill in 2005 that would give a new
regulator fresh powers to oversee Fannie and Freddie - the No.
1 and 2 U.S. mortgage finance companies, respectively. Similar legislation passed the Senate Banking Committee but
stalled over the question of how to oversee the companies' $1.4
trillion investment portfolio. The Treasury, Federal Reserve Board and White House have
all said the companies' investment portfolios are dangerously
bloated. Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, has said he reached a deal
with the Treasury Department late in last year's legislative
session that clears the way for a compromise. Language worked out between the House and Treasury would
give a new regulator broad authority to control the companies'
investment portfolios without explicitly ordering them to shed
those investments.
