transferred the market authorization of its ATryn drug to its
distribution and development partner, LEO Pharma A/S, in the
run-up to the drug's commercial launch in Europe around the end
of the second quarter. The transfer enables LEO to enter into negotiations on
reimbursement rates for ATryn, the company said in a statement. ATryn is an anti-clotting agent for people with a rare
inherited disease that is made from the milk of transgenic
goats. GTC said it expects to use $26 million to $29 million of
cash in 2007 for forecasted sales of ATryn in the approved
indication as well as to LEO for its Phase II study for severe
clotting associated with sepsis.
