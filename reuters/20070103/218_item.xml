which is being acquired by Bank of New York Co. Inc. (BK.N),
said on Wednesday it has sold stakes in the portfolios of its
venture capital business, resulting in an after-tax loss of
about $70 million. Mellon said the stakes in the portfolios of Mellon Ventures
were sold to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N) affiliate Goldman
Sachs Private Investments Ltd. and New MVI LP. "The sale of the venture capital portfolio is consistent
with Mellon's strategic focus on asset management and servicing
businesses," Mellon said in a regulatory filing. Bank of New York announced in December it would buy Mellon
for $16.5 billion to create Bank of New York Mellon Corp., a
powerhouse in custody services with $16.6 trillion of assets
under administration and one of the biggest asset managers. The
deal is expected to close around July 1. Mellon also said in the filing that it will include in its
fourth-quarter 2006 results a tax benefit of about $75 million,
primarily related to a reversal of deferred tax liabilities. Mellon shares were up 0.74 percent at $42.46 in early
trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares rose 23
percent in 2006.
