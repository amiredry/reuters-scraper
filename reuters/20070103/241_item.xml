on Wednesday to seal the takeover by Brazil's Companhia Vale do
Rio Doce (VALE5.SA) (RIO.N), taking a mining sector icon out of
Canadian hands. CVRD, the biggest iron ore producer in the world, has
already taken control of Inco and holds about 87.8 percent of
Inco's outstanding shares. Inco had called a meeting for shareholders to consider a
transaction by way of amalgamation, a legal procedure so that
CVRD could take up 100 percent of the nickel producer.
