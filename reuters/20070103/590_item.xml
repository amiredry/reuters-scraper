channel has landed a deal to be carried on Time Warner Inc.'s 
cable service if the channel is launched, Fox said on 
Wednesday. The deal, whose terms were undisclosed, is part of a larger 
renewal agreement for Fox News, the Speed Channel and carriage 
of Fox owned-and-operated TV stations on Time Warner's cable 
service, according to a report in trade publication 
Multichannel News. News Corp. executives have said they aim to launch a cable 
television business network competitor to NBC Universal's CNBC, 
a cash cow for the General Electric-controlled media and 
entertainment company. Last year, Fox secured an agreement for the planned 
business channel to be carried to the digital cable subscribers 
of top U.S. cable operator Comcast Corp.'s territory. Comcast 
serves about 24 million subscribers over all. According to the Multichannel report, Time Warner will pay 
10 cents to 15 cents monthly per subscriber license fee for the 
Fox business channel if it launches. A Fox spokeswoman confirmed the company had reached a 
distribution deal for the new channel with Time Warner, but 
declined to give more details.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/industry-newscorp-timewarner-dc-idUSN0339023620070103</link><sectors></sectors><title>fox business channel lands time warner cable deal</title></story></items>
