612-megawatt Unit 3 at the Brayton Point coal/natural gas-fired
station in Massachusetts shut for short -term work by early
Wednesday, according to electricity traders. Officials at Dominion were not immediately available for
comment on the outage. The traders said the company shut the unit to fix a tube
leak. The Brayton Point station is located in Bristol County
about 50 miles (80 km) south of Boston. One MW powers about 1,000 homes in Massachusetts. Dominion owns and operates more than 28,000 MW of
generating capacity, markets energy commodities, and transmits
and distributes electricity and natural gas to more than five
million customers in eight states.
