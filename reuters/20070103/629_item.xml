to close at an eight-month closing high on Thursday, the first
trading day of 2007, with Toyota Motor Corp. (7203.T) rising on
news that it became one of the Big Three automakers in 2006 and
other exporters advanced on a softer yen. Tokyo markets were open for a half day of business on
Thursday from 09:00-11:00 a.m. (0000 GMT-0200 GMT). They were
closed Monday through Wednesday for the New Year's holidays. Investors also bought NTT DoCoMo Inc. (9437.T) after the
Nikkei business daily said Japan's largest mobile operator would
keep initial investment in its so-called super 3G network down to
100-200 billion yen, which may enable DoCoMo to cut its fees and
help retain users. [ID:nT142263] The Nikkei finished up 127.84 points at 17,353.67, the
highest close since April 21. The broader TOPIX index .TOPX
rose 1.06 percent to 1,698.95.
