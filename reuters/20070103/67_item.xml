anniversary, the CBS daytime drama "Guiding Light" is throwing 
a party online. The show is launching www.FindYourLight.net 
Wednesday, an interactive Web site that encourages viewers to 
upload videos and view behind-the-scenes content featuring the 
show's cast while introducing the series' yearlong "Find Your 
Light" campaign encouraging volunteerism. User-generated content will focus on themes of inspiration 
and mimic an ongoing series of interstitials that will begin 
airing on the show this month featuring cast members speaking 
about what inspires them. Holder of the Guinness World Record as the longest-running 
show in broadcast history, "Guiding Light" debuted on radio in 
1937 and transitioned to television in 1952 before becoming the 
first TV show to podcast audio-only episodes in 2005.
