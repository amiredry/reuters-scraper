On fiscal policy, Ota said the government might be able to\nbring forward its key fiscal reform target from the current\nself-imposed deadline of fiscal 2011/12 due to rising tax\nrevenues. But she said the priority should be put on pursuing spending\ncuts, adding that it was \"disappointing\" to see growing calls\namong politicians that the government can restore fiscal health\nwithout raising the consumption tax rate from the current 5\npercent.

CR Snow, a venture between SABMiller and beverage-to-retail\ngiant China Resources Enterprise Ltd. (0291.HK), intends to pay\n2.5 billion yuan (US$320 million) for Blue Sword, which owns part\nof 14 breweries sprinkled across Sichuan province and all of a\nbrewery in Guizhou. The firm, the current market leader, intends to complete the\nacquisition of those assets -- which collectively posted a 40\npercent jump in unaudited net profit to US$12.4 million in 2005\n-- in 2007's first quarter, China Resources and SABMiller said in\nstatements on Thursday. \"This acquisition further demonstrates CR Snow's commitment\nto invest in prominent local brands which not only complements\nour national branding strategy but strengthens our leading\npositions throughout regional markets,\" said Andre Parker,\nmanaging director of SABMiller Africa and Asia. Blue Sword's 14 breweries in Sichuan can produce about 14\nmillion hectolitres annually and the company is expanding to add\nsome 1.6 million hectolitres of capacity, SABMiller said. (For a full statement, please click here) SABMiller expects its Chinese beer Snow to become the group's\nbiggest brand in 2006 and one of the world's top four beers, but\nexecutives concede that expanding profits will take time because\na 640 ml bottle can sell for as little as the equivalent of 12\nU.S. cents. CR Snow now accounts for nearly a fifth of SABMiller's global\nbeer volumes but less than 5 percent of profits. That venture vies with local leader Tsingtao Brewery Co. Ltd.\n(600600.SS) (0168.HK) and ahead of foreign rivals Anheuser-Busch\n(BUD.N) and InBev INTB.BR, in a market that is growing at up to\n10 percent annually. Analysts estimate Snow volumes could have hit 26-27 million\nhectolitres for 2006, ahead of Miller Lite, which had volumes of\n22 million in 2005, and probably behind only Budweiser, Brazil's\nSkol and Mexican beer Corona in global rankings. Much of SABMiller's growth in China have come from takeovers\nengineered alongside partner China Resources: last year, the pair\nbought breweries in northern China's Shanxi province and Inner\nMongolia, among others. Their venture commands about 14.9 percent of China's market,\nexceeding Tsingtao's 13.9 percent share at the end of June 2006.

{"date": "21:24 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "SYDNEY Australian energy retailer AGL Energy Ltd. AGK.AX said it has approached Origin Energy Ltd. (ORG.AX) about a potential A$13 billion ($10 billion) tie-up to create the country's biggest gas and electricity supplier.AGL said on Thursday that the merger was based on a \"nil premium scrip\" basis, which meant neither company would pay a premium to gain control of the combined entity.The news sent AGL's shares up over 4.6 percent to A$16.57 by 0129 GMT. But Origin, whose shares have risen over 10 percent in the past month as takeover speculation grew, fell as much as 3.5 percent on disappointment that there would be no higher offer.Analysts said a merger of the two companies would create significant cost savings and scale benefits, but stringent requirements laid down by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) could scuttle the deal.\"They could try to satisfy the ACCC by selling off some of their business in some states but they would have to divest a significant amount of assets and one would have to ask how they are going to achieve the synergies with these sizeable divestments,\" said Paul Johnston, an analyst at Commsec Ltd.A combined entity would have a 49 percent market share of retail customers on Australia's east coast, with a significant overlap in Victoria state, where AGL and Origin would control more than two-thirds of the market.Analysts said other factors that could also break the deal included whether AGL's chief Paul Anthony or his Origin counterpart Grant King, would head the new group.Origin confirmed the merger approach, which it said was unsolicited and that it was still evaluating the proposal. The Melbourne-based company added that the proposal was only indicative and preliminary, and that it was not at present in any talks with AGL.\"Essentially what they are trying to say is AGL could launch a hostile bid, if they want to. There is no conversation between parties. That means they are still long way off before it (the deal) happens,\" said Albert Hung, chief investment officer with Alleron Investment Management.The plan maintains the pace of merger and acquisition activity in Australia, which jumped to a record US$171 billion in announced deals in 2006, according to Thomson Financial, aided by a surge in private equity takeovers.COMPLEMENTARY PROFILESThe Australian power sector has seen a flurry of takeover activity in the past year as companies compete to grow their infrastructure portfolios in the increasingly competitive market and as the Victorian state government embarks on a privatization policy for its energy assets.A combined AGL-Origin group would have more than 6 million customers, a controlling interest in New Zealand's largest power generator and retailer Contact Energy (CEN.NZ), and a collection of power plants and oil and gas fields across Australia.AGL's Managing Director Paul Anthony said in a statement that AGL has for some months assessed the benefits of combining the two entities, adding there was a \"compelling case\" to merge due to the complementary business profiles of each company.Combining the two businesses would unlock significant economic and financial benefits, including advancing the monetization of Origin's gas reserves, reducing AGL's need to acquire gas reserves and allow for a significant reduction in duplicated operating costs.In October last year, AGL sold A$6 billion worth of its infrastructure assets to Alinta AAN.AX, while maintaining its retailing and generating assets, in exchange for one-third of Alinta's Western Australian retail and co-generation business.The Australian Stock Exchange queried Origin last month about its rising share price after media reports that the company could face a bid.Origin said then it was not aware of any information that had not been announced which, if known, could explain trading in its shares.($1=1.26 Australian Dollar)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/04/us-origin-agl-idUSSYD13949520070104", "sectors": [], "title": "agl proposes a $ 13 billion tie - up with origin"},

After years spent in script development, a fourth \ninstallment of the hit franchise is set to begin production in \nJune in locations around the world and in the United States. It \nwill mark Spielberg's next directorial outing. \"George, Harrison and I are all very excited,\" Spielberg \nsaid. \"We feel that the script was well worth the wait.

I'm \nlooking forward to reuniting with the team and starting this \nnew journey.\" For the moment, the title of the new film as well as its \nstory line are being kept under wraps. The film will be produced by Lucasfilm Ltd. and released \nworldwide by Paramount Pictures, the parent company of \nDreamWorks, which Spielberg co-founded. David Koepp, who has penned such previous Spielberg \nprojects as \"Jurassic Park\" and \"War of the Worlds,\" wrote the \nscreenplay that finally got the stamp of approval from Lucas \nand Spielberg. An earlier screenplay by Frank Darabont was \nshelved when Lucas turned thumbs down on it. Although a spokesman for Spielberg said Monday that no \ncasting has begun, Lucas and Ford have said that they would \nlike to include Sean Connery, who played Indiana Jones' father, \nProfessor Henry Jones, in \"The Last Crusade.\" \"We are writing \nhim in whether he wants to do it or not,\" Lucas told \"Access \nHollywood\" when Connery was honored in June with the American \nFilm Institute's Life Achievement Award.

Annan and leading U.N. rights officials also have opposed capital punishment, as has the European Union.The U.N. special representative in Iraq, Ashraf Qazi, released a statement on Sunday saying the world body \"remains opposed to capital punishment, even in the case of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.\"Ban's new spokeswoman, Michele Montas of Haiti, said \"the U.N. policy still remains that the organization is not for capital punishment.\" She said Ban's comments were nuanced but would not say whether he agreed with Qazi.While Ban, 62, intends to make a fresh start, he is being pressured by the United States, Britain, France and others for control of key departments -- as were his predecessors.EXPECTED APPOINTMENTSSir John Holmes, Britain's ambassador to France, is expected to head the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, formerly run by Jan Egeland, who resigned last month and returned to Norway, U.N. sources said.The Times of London accused British Prime Minister Tony Blair of cronyism for championing a personal friend and said Holmes had little experience, compared with Egeland, in relief work.It is uncertain what post the United States will get. Washington had been interested in the peacekeeping department but most envoys believe Jean-Marie Guehenno of France will stay on the job, at least for the time being.The United States for years held the management and administration department, which is now expected to go to Alicia Barcena, a Mexican biologist and environmentalist who served as Annan's chief of staff.Ban's main message to the staff was that \"morale has plummeted\" in recent years when the bureaucracy was the target of harsh criticism.\"Not all the criticisms are justified but some of them warrant our urgent attention and we must take bold steps to dispel them,\" he said.Ban also told reporters the crisis in Sudan's Darfur region was \"very high on my agenda\" and that he would meet with his special envoy Jan Eliasson of Sweden on Wednesday morning.Ban said he would attend an African Union summit at the end of January in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and talk there with Sudan's President Omar Hassan al-Bashir.The United Nations is seeking to get a peacekeeping force in Sudan's arid Darfur region, where violence has escalated and more than 2.5 million people have lost their homes. Bashir has put conditions on a U.N. peacekeeping force to bolster the under-financed 7,000 African Union troops now in Darfur.((Editing by Bill Trott; Reuters messaging: Evelyn.Leopold.reuters.com@reuters.net; 1-212-355-7424)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-un-leader-idUSN0232801820070103", "sectors": [], "title": "new un chief keeps distance from death penalty ban"},

(7203.T) rising on news that it became one of the Big Three\nautomakers in 2006 and other exporters advanced on a softer yen. Tokyo markets are open for a half day of business on Thursday\nfrom 09:00-11:00 a.m. (0000 GMT-0200 GMT). They were closed\nMonday through Wednesday for New Year's holidays. \"The Nikkei is up following solid growth in U.S. and European\nmarkets during our market holidays,\" said Tsuyoshi Segawa, an\nequity strategist at Shinko Securities. \"The fact that the yen has been getting softer since the end\nof last year and that market participants tend to focus on\nhopeful stocks for the year, Toyota and Nippon Steel for example,\nis also helping the rise.\" The Nikkei was up 144.56 points at 17,370.39 as of 0107 GMT.\nThe broader TOPIX index .TOPX gained 1.18 percent to 1,700.90. Segawa said gains may be limited into next week, however, as\ninvestors are concerned that stocks might have risen too far. Shares of Toyota rose 2 percent at 8,120 yen following data\nshowing its sales rose more than 16 percent in the United States\nin December, ousting DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE to become one of\nthe Big Three automakers in 2006. Toyota's stock earlier hit a record high of 8,140 yen. Investors were also encouraged to buy Toyota and other\nautomakers with the dollar trading near a 12-week high versus the\nyen. Honda Motor Co. (7267.T) gained 1.3 percent at 4,760 yen and\nNissan Motor Co. (7201.T) added 2.1 percent at 1,463 yen.

{"date": "23:48 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "  (Adds quotes, details) By Fang YanSHANGHAI Jan 4 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co.'s (005380.KS)\nChinese joint venture missed its 2006 sales target on fierce\nmarket competition and sees slower growth this year due largely\nto capacity restraints, a company executive said on Thursday. Beijing Hyundai Automotive Corp., a 50-50 joint venture\nbetween South Korea's biggest auto maker and Beijing Automotive,\nsold roughly 290,000 cars last year, 10,000 units shy of its\nearlier target of 300,000 units, the executive said. Sales are estimated to climb only 6.9 percent to 310,000\nunits in 2007, mainly due to limited capacity, said the\nexecutive, who asked not to be identified. Such growth would be considerably slower than the venture's\n24 percent sales increase seen in 2006, and the 15 percent growth\nexpected for the China car market in 2007. \"We are adding capacity now but it won't be available this\nyear,\" the executive told Reuters. Beijing Hyundai, based in the Chinese capital, has a designed\nannual capacity of 300,000 vehicles. It is building a second\nplant in the city, to add 200,000 units of capacity by early\n2008, increasing to 300,000 units by the end of that year. But until then, the venture would not aggressively roll out\nnew models -- an effective way to lure customers in the world's\nsecond-largest and hotly-contested auto market, another company\nexecutive said. Hyundai, which competes with Toyota Motor Corp. (7203.T) and\nothers in China, had made headway in Beijing and surrounding\nareas, helped largely by its hot-selling mid-range Elantra sedan. However, it has seen weaker sales in Shanghai, the homebase\nof the local ventures of Volkswagen AG (VOWG.DE) and General\nMotors Corp. (GM.N), where many local buyers favour Santana and\nExcelle over the Hyundai Accent. Globally, the South Korean automaker moved an estimated 2.5\nmillion cars in 2006, lower than its target of 2.69 million\nunits, hit by unionised workers' strikes.\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/04/hyundai-chinasales-idUSSHA17012320070104", "sectors": [], "title": "update 1 - hyundai motor china jv sees slow 2007 sales rise"},

{"date": "19:42 31 December 2006 (UTC)", "text": " NEW YORK (Billboard) - You can't blame U2's concert \npromoter for wondering just how big the band's Vertigo world \ntour could have been if it had simply kept on playing. After all, not one ticket went unsold for the 131 shows on \nthe trek, which began March 28, 2005, in San Diego and wrapped \nDecember 9 in front of 47,000 fans at Honolulu's Aloha Stadium. Having been on the road in fits and starts since March \n2005, U2 was clearly in a celebratory mood in Hawaii, as Bono \ndanced onstage with a woman from the crowd during \"Mysterious \nWays\" and even pulled a lucky guy out of the audience to play \npiano with the band during \"Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses.\" \nWhether waving the American flag high above his head amid \nopener \"City of Blinding Lights\" or writhing on the stage \nblindfolded for \"Bullet the Blue Sky,\" the frontman was holding \nnothing back. When all was said and done, Vertigo clocked in as the \nsecond-highest grossing tour of all time: $389 million from an \nastonishing audience of 4,619,021, second only to the Rolling \nStones' concurrent A Bigger Bang trek, which may continue into \n2007, and has grossed more. \"I sometimes try and visualize, what would be the \nuniverse?\" promoter Arthur Fogel told Billboard. \"In other \nwords, what if you could just play and play and play? We sold \nover four-and-a-half million tickets on this tour, but we still \nunderplayed basically everywhere we've gone.\" Vertigo visited arenas in North America through late May \n2005, then played stadiums in Europe throughout that summer. In \nthe fall, it was back to North America for a run that included \nsix shows at Toronto's Air Canada Center and six at New York's \nMadison Square Garden. February and March took U2 to South America, which was \noriginally to be followed by dates in Australia, New Zealand \nand Japan. Those shows, however, were postponed until the fall \ndue to a serious illness that struck within the immediate \nfamily of a band member. Details have never been publicly \ndisclosed. Getting Vertigo back on track was the final hurdle for \nFogel. He and U2 manager Paul McGuinness say they're in contact \nall the time, even a year before the first fan has filed into a \nvenue. \"As the record develops, the production develops,\" \nMcGuinness said. \"And depending on when the record is finished, \nwe have an imaginary start date. That's subject to change, but \nthe thinking about the production is always simultaneous with \nthe making of the album.\" The Vertigo stage set featured an ellipse-shaped extension \nthat allowed band members to travel far into the \ngeneral-admission crowd on the floor. It required 30 semi \ntrucks to get from place to place, according to stage manager \nRocko Reedy. On a good day, it took two-and-a-half hours to \nassemble, but that duration could nearly double depending on \nweather and venue configurations. After being loaded post-show \nonto the trucks, the stage was packed onto three 747s to travel \nto the next venue. Early in the tour, U2 performed in front of seven \nsee-through LED curtains, onto which images and patterns were \nprojected. Later, a giant, super high-tech LED screen was used \ninstead to form the backdrop. \"All the stuff we use is always serial number 001,\" Reedy \nsaid. \"The first time they create this type of technology, it's \nU2 that uses it. Then everybody else under the sun goes out and \ngets it, so we just have to come up with something new.\" That said, Vertigo has not been without its share of drama. \nThe tour got off to a rocky start after a disastrous presale \nfor paid members of u2.com in January 2005, when demand far \nexceeded the ticket allotment, prompting shut-out fans to blast \nmanagement and even band members themselves on Internet forums. \"The demand was artificially stimulated because, quite \nhonestly, a lot of ticket scalpers had joined u2.com planning \nto trade the tickets,\" McGuinness said. \"It was clear very \nearly those tickets would have a higher resale value than face \nvalue. We got caught by that, and we certainly underestimated \nthe demand that would arise through the fan club. We did the \nbest we could to meet it. But we'll be a little more careful \nnext time.\" Then, in the wake of the Asia-Pacific postponements, Fogel \nspent months dealing with insurance issues. \"That process took \na very long time and was very difficult in complex, but \nultimately resulted favorably,\" he says. \"That probably was a \nmuch greater challenge than the actual logistics of bringing \nthe production and personnel back together. \"We had a few venue issues (rescheduling) in Japan, because \noriginally we were playing outdoors at Yokohama Stadium,\" he \nadded. \"Given we were now in early December, the weather is \nsuch that we had to then look to go indoors. So, we had to \nbasically refund 60,000 tickets and then resell for three shows \nat an arena.\" But, to the surprise of nobody, the fans were still right \nthere waiting to attend the makeup dates. \"In Australia, even \nthough we were postponing the shows by six months or so, almost \nno customers asked for a refund,\" McGuinness said. And indeed, \nthe time off allowed U2 to rejigger the tour set list, as well \nas record \"The Saints Are Coming\" and the new song \"Window in \nthe Skies\" with producer Rick Rubin. Both were released on the \ncompilation \"U218 Singles\" in November. While it may have been tempting to entertain adding still \nmore shows to the itinerary after the fall leg, McGuinness said \nthis was \"a logical point to stop. We're obviously aware we \ncould go on and on and on, but selling out (venues) is actually \nmore important to us than the gross.\" So where does the U2 go from here? The first destination is \nthe recording studio, sometime in 2007, with an eye on \nreleasing a new album by the end of the year. McGuinness \npredicted the next tour would then begin in 2008. \"All I can say is it will be completely different the next \ntime, but it will be big,\" he said. \"I think our audience \nexpects very big productions. We've become good at doing that, \nand I think it is part of U2's reputation.\" The band may even \nexperiment with commercially releasing select concerts as \ndownloads shortly after their completion. \"That's something \nwe're exploring,\" McGuinness acknowledged. \"In the future there \nwill be more what we call 'band-to-fan activity.\"' Reuters/Billboard", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/music-u2-dc-idUSN2925649020070103", "sectors": [["Music"]], "title": "u2 : from joshua trees to palm trees"},
{"date": "01:16 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "DETROIT The Detroit Red Wings paid Steve Yzerman the ultimate tribute on Tuesday, retiring his number 19 jersey and raising it to the rafters of Joe Louis Arena in a stirring pre-game ceremony.Then in the unselfish fashion that defined his career, Yzerman offered his encouragement to a troubled city that had inspired him for 22 NHL seasons.With Detroit's battered auto industry casting a dark shadow of layoffs and unemployment over the city, Yzerman used the ceremonies to deliver the type of pep talk that helped establish him as one of the NHL's all-time great leaders.The Red Wings also produced an inspired effort, capping off the celebrations with a 2-1 win over the NHL leading Anaheim Ducks.\"I came to Detroit as an 18-year-old boy and was immediately drawn to the lore of the Detroit Red Wings,\" said Yzerman, who spent his entire career in a Detroit jersey before retiring at the end of last season.\"There has not been a time since I came to Detroit that I have regretted or been disappointed about playing here.\"I think of the Red Wings and how our organization was rebuilt and became a champion, I think is very similar to what is going on in the city.\"It's a very difficult time but I think we can look back on what has transpired for the Detroit Red Wings over the last 20 years.\"Our organization has had strong leadership and dedicated players and everyone with a common goal, which was to bring a championship back to the city.\"I think that single-mindedness, that willingness to work together are exactly the kind of things that it will take to rebuild our city.\"THREE CUPSSelected by Detroit with the fourth overall pick in the 1983 draft, Yzerman became the cornerstone around which the dilapidated franchise that had become known as the 'Dead Things' would rebuild.In just his third season, the 20-year-old Yzerman became the Red Wings captain and wore the 'C' for 20-years, the longest tenure in NHL history, leading Detroit to three Stanley Cups in 1997, 1998 and 2002.While Yzerman was celebrated for his leadership skills he was also one of the NHL's most complete players, finishing his career among the league's all-time scoring leaders with 692 goals and 1,755 points.His trophy case is also packed with individual honors, including the Conn Smythe Trophy as the Stanley Cup playoffs MVP.One of the NHL's original six franchises, Yzerman becomes only the sixth Detroit player in the team's 81-year history to have his number officially retired, joining Gordie Howe, Terry Sawchuk, Ted Lindsay, Alex Delvecchio and Sid Abel in the Joe Louis rafters.Earlier in the day, Yzerman was handed a key to the city to go along with a key to a new car and a street named in his honor.The current Red Wings also presented Yzerman with a trip to Vienna and tickets for the final of the 2008 Euro championships.\"I feel like my image as a great leader is greatly overblown because I played with some great hockey players,\" offered a humble Yzerman, watched by his family, former-team mates and a sellout crowd of 20,066 during the 80 minute ceremony.\"Any personal success I had was because of the great players I played with.\"", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-nhl-yzerman-idUSSP15625120070103", "sectors": [["Sports"]], "title": "yzerman inspires detroit to victory after number retired"},
{"date": "21:15 01 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " NEW YORK (Hollywood Reporter) - Major news outlets faced an \nultimate ethical dilemma -- whether to televise an execution -- \nwhen what appeared to be cell phone video emerged Saturday from \nthe scene of Saddam Hussein's execution. Some U.S. networks ran \nportions of the video, which predictably spread like wildfire \nthrough the Internet. Fox News Channel was the first to run some of the footage \nshortly after 4 p.m. EST Saturday. The grainy, shaky video \nincludes an angle of the hanging and audio of sometimes testy \nexchanges between Saddam, his executioners and witnesses as the \nformer dictator is led to the gallows. It wasn't clear who shot the video, which appeared on a Web \nsite and then on a pan-Arab news channel, or how it made its \nway to the public. The video was later uploaded to APTN, the \nAssociated Press' video news service, which made it available \nto every network. \"The real journalistic value of the footage, if it is \nauthentic, is that it gives you much more of the context \nsurrounding his execution,\" said CNN president Jon Klein. \"You \nlearn so much more about what really was said, and how fraught \nwith sectarian fervor the whole issue was. That could not be \nconveyed better than listening to the sound of the moment, even \nmore so than the video.\" \"It was a different angle of what we had already seen,\" \nsaid David Rhodes, vp news at Fox News Channel. \"It was useful \nbecause there's some audio on it that you didn't necessarily \nhear in the previous version, and it's a fuller picture as to \nwhat was happening. You can hear all the principals speaking.\" Fox News Channel wasn't willing to carry anything further \nthan where it had stopped with the government-provided \nvideotape, when the noose was being fitted around Saddam's \nneck. The cell phone video continues with Saddam's body falling \nthrough the trap door but no U.S. network ran that portion on \nthe air. CNN too showed the video up to the noose, not \nnecessarily because of any camera angle but, like others, \nbecause of the audio. CNN's Web site showed the tape only up to the point just \nbefore Saddam fell; Fox News' site \n(one.revver.com/watch/130549) showed what appeared to be \nthe entire video, including Saddam's body on the ground with \nhis neck broken. Both sites warned viewers about the graphic \nnature. MSNBC.com, on the other hand, adhered to the standards of \nNBC News and didn't show the graphic parts of the video. NBC \nNews showed some of the Iraqi government's video and reporting \nby Richard Engel of what eyewitnesses said, along with a shot \nof Saddam's body wrapped in a shroud with his head poking out \n-- the same shot, NBC News president Steve Capus noted, that \nwas on the front page of the New York Times. But in consultation with his deputies including standards \nvp David McCormack and senior vp Alex Wallace, Capus ruled most \nof the cell phone video off-limits. \"I really don't believe that it's appropriate to show much \nof that,\" Capus said Sunday afternoon. \"It shows the execution, \nand we're not going to show that. I don't believe it's \nappropriate to show that to the audience, I don't think it's \nour responsibility to show an actual execution on video tape.\" Even though Saddam has been dead since Friday night U.S. \ntime, the specter of even more video could lead to another \nround of soul-searching by the U.S. networks. Fox News' Rhodes \ndidn't rule out running other video if it surfaces. \"There's definitely an argument to run it and arguments not \nto,\" Rhodes said Sunday.

{"date": "22:55 01 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - One can imagine the \npained expression on the face of Howard Morris, the creator of \nABC's \"In Case of Emergency,\" when CBS premiered \"The Class\" \nlast fall. One of the fall's better sitcoms, \"The Class\" is about \nformer classmates who reunite after not seeing each other for \nyears. They've had varying degrees of success but never quite \nmeasured up to the promise of their school years. At the center \nof the group is a genuinely nice guy who's been dumped by his \ngirl. Another classmate is on the verge of suicide. \"Emergency\" has enough similarities -- right down to the \ndumped guy and the near-suicide -- that it could be a response \nto the same classroom assignment. The similarity of the two \npremises makes comparison inevitable which is too bad because \n\"Emergency,\" especially the pilot episode, is a solid sitcom \nwith a strong cast and a lot of potential. There's room for improvement, of course. Jonathan \nSilverman, who plays jilted greeting card writer and all-around \nnice guy Harry Kennison, needs to take his performance down a \nnotch or two. Also, there's no clear need for Dr. Joanna, the \ncharacter played by Lori Loughlin. She catches the eye of Jason \nVentress (David Arquette) after she patches him up following \nthe suicide scene but the relationship is forced and awkward, a \nspeed bump in an otherwise smooth and well-paced show. The others in the ensemble are Kelly Lee (Kelly Hu), the \nclass valedictorian who ended up providing sensual Korean \nmassages, and Sherman Yablonsky (Greg Germann), who shed his \nhigh school girth and became the author of a bestselling diet \nbook. When Sherman's wife splits unexpectedly, the shock sends \nhim back to binge eating. The show operates at a frantic pace -- sometimes too \nfrantic -- but it has its funny moments as well. Hu is adept at \nphysical comedy and \"Ally McBeal\" alumnus Germann makes his \npathetic character oddly appealing. Morris mixes heart with \nhumor and blends smart dialogue with visual gags so that you \nnever have to wait long for the next laugh. You get the feeling \nthat if this show is given enough time to find its strengths \nand understand its characters, it could be around for quite \nsome time.

{"date": "01:28 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "KAPALUA, Hawaii Three-times champion Nick Faldo will enter uncharted territory when he returns to Augusta National for this year's Masters in April.For the first time since making his debut there in 1979, the former world number one will appear at the opening major of the season as a non-competitor.Although the experience will be different, Faldo says he will have no regrets when he drives through the entry gate and along leafy Magnolia Lane toward the clubhouse for the April 5-8 tournament.\"I've had my playing career, I've been out there 30 years and this is a great opportunity for me to do something different,\" the 49-year-old Briton told Reuters in an interview.Having cut his teeth as a television golf analyst for ABC Sports over the last two years, Faldo will perform the same duty at Augusta National for CBS Sports, broadcasters of the Masters since 1956.\"I don't want to be a player who's an amateur,\" Faldo added. \"I'm now an analyst and I will be in the tower at Augusta for the whole week.\"Obviously my golf has really been curtailed and I'm quite happy about that. My playing days aren't completely over but my priority now is given to CBS.\"Faldo, Masters champion in 1989 and 1990 before claiming a third title in 1996, realized his playing days at Augusta National were probably over during last year's tournament.\"I stood just off the ninth fairway in the rough with a three-iron in my hand going: 'I can't hit it on the green, there's no way I can get this damn thing on the green',\" he recalled.GIANT BUNKERS\"I had giant bunkers up the left and knew, even if I hit it on the green, it would repel and bounce off.\"So I thought: 'Okay it's getting tough now and I haven't got the game to seriously compete at Augusta any more.'\"Now I am quite happy to go up in the booth and do the best that I can calling the action,\" added the Englishman, who missed the halfway cut at last year's Masters after shooting 79 and 74.\"I'm very excited about it and I will take on the challenge again.\"Faldo, whose career haul of six majors also included three victories at the British Open, will replace Lanny Wadkins as lead golf analyst for CBS in the tower.He is expected to shine in his new role, having earned a glowing reputation over the last two years with ABC for his blend of wit and insightful comments.Known for his taciturn persona on the golf course when establishing himself as the dominant player of his generation, Faldo has become a veritable chatterbox in the broadcast booth.Several leading players in the modern game say his analysis has allowed them to understand more clearly his on-course thinking as a six-times major champion.COMMENTATING STYLEAsked to describe his commentating style, Faldo replied: \"I just duck and dive and go with the flow each week. If you know what you're going to get, there's no point in having me.\"I've enjoyed giving my insight, and I've enjoyed the experience of just being there watching the golf tournaments.\"Faldo will also work as lead PGA Tour analyst this year for the Golf Channel, starting at this week's season-opening Mercedes-Benz Championship in Hawaii.The Golf Channel, signed up by the Tour for 15 years, will broadcast the first three events as well as the Thursday and Friday rounds for the rest of the season.A major benefit for Faldo, Europe's Ryder Cup captain for next year, is that he will be able to closely monitor the growing number of Europeans competing on the PGA Tour.\"My finger will be on the pulse and I will know all the scores,\" he said. \"I'll certainly keep my eyes on what the guys are up to.\"The 2008 Ryder Cup will take place at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky, from September 19-21.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-golf-faldo-idUSN0128009920070103", "sectors": [["Sports"]], "title": "new lease of life for faldo at augusta"},

Vakarai is one of the last major rebel-areas on the eastern coast.More than 3,000 people were killed last year in suicide bombings, air and naval raids and clashes. Both sides say they stand by a 2002 ceasefire, but international monitors say it now exists only on paper.\"The United Nations calls once more for a cessation of hostilities between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and resumption of the peace process,\" the UN statement said.((Editing by Bill Tarrant; Reuters Messaging:sanjeev.miglani.reuters.com@reuters.net;+ 94-1-431187)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-srilanka-violence-idUSSP16512220070103", "sectors": [["World"]], "title": "u . n . urges end to sri lanka fighting after deaths"},

Security Council imposed sanctions on North Korea -- aimed at curbing the North's weapons trade and imports of luxury goods for its leaders -- after it defied international warnings and conducted its first nuclear test in October.In a joint new year editorial carried by state newspapers, the North acknowledged its farms face difficulties.\"We should, as in the past, keep up farming as the great foundation of the country and make an epoch-making advance in solving the problem of food for the people,\" the editorial said.Much of the North's food shortfall has been made up with international aid in previous years, but South Korea -- one of the largest single donors of food -- suspended its food handouts last year.Famine in North Korea during the 1990s brought about by years of floods, drought and mismanaged farm policy killed at least 1 million and as many as 2.5 million, according to some studies.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-korea-north-food-idUSSEO14648920070103", "sectors": [["World"]], "title": "no food crisis in north korea despite floods : paper"},

Peacekeeping Department in New York declined to comment. The report appeared on the first day of work for U.N. leader Ban Ki-moon of South Korea, who this week became the world body's eighth secretary-general, succeeding Kofi Annan of Ghana.There are more than 11,000 U.N. peacekeepers and police from some 70 countries in southern Sudan, enforcing a January 2005 peace agreement that ended a 21-year civil war.The Telegraph said the first signs of sexual exploitation of local youths in southern Sudan emerged within months of the peacekeepers' arrival in March 2005. The U.N. Children's Fund UNICEF drafted an internal report detailing the problem, it said.The newspaper said Sudan's government had gathered evidence including video footage of U.N. workers having sex with young girls. But the United Nations has yet to publicly acknowledge there was a problem or even investigate, the newspaper said.The United Nations, working with the African Union, is now pressing the Sudanese government to admit thousands more peacekeepers to its western Darfur region, where a separate civil war has raged for three years.The government has been resisting letting the reinforcements into Darfur, calling it an attempt to recolonize the vast northern African nation.Sexual abuse charges have surfaced for decades in U.N. peacekeeping missions and among civilian and other humanitarian staff operating in world hot spots.But the United Nations began seriously pursuing offenders in the past two years after reports of widespread abuse in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it has 17,000 troops.Since January 2004, the United Nations has investigated abuse allegations against 319 military and civilian personnel in all its missions, the world body said in late November.It has disciplined 179 soldiers, civilians and police since then but acknowledges minors and the poor are still exploited.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-un-sudan-peacekeepers-idUSN0235661520070103", "sectors": [["World"]], "title": "u . n . troops in south sudan raping children : report"},

{"date": "01:00 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " (Adds details) By Deborah HaynesLONDON Jan 3 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel\nsaid in comments published on Wednesday the European Union and\nthe United States should more closely harmonise their financial\nmarket regulations, patent laws and other economic mechanisms. In an interview with the Financial Times before a trip to\nWashington this week, Merkel outlined her goals for Germany's\nsix-month rotating presidency of the European Union and its\nyear-long presidency of the Group of Eight nations. Merkel said closer harmony between the 27-nation EU bloc and\nthe United States would boost investment flows and trade. \"We have accumulated a certain expertise about single\nmarkets in Europe, which we can apply on the transatlantic\nlevel,\" she told the newspaper, according to an edited\ntranscript of the interview published on the FT's Web site. \"With increasing globalisation, this can be a good basis for\ntransatlantic cooperation.\" Merkel said she would touch on this topic during talks with\nU.S. President George W. Bush in Washington this week. \"The EU and the U.S. have sophisticated patent legislation.\nWe have regulatory mechanisms governing our financial markets.\nWe should be looking for ways to keep developing these together\nat a transatlantic level,\" she said. \"We must watch out that we do not drift apart, but instead\ncome closer together, where there are clear advantages for both\nsides.\" Germany's relationship with the United States cooled under\nprevious Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder but has improved since\nMerkel took over in 2005.\n \"QUITE SENSELESS\" Merkel dismissed concerns that countries such as China and\nJapan would regard a closer partnership between the United\nStates and Europe as hostile. \"Building bulkheads against Asia would be quite senseless,\nand certainly not in our interest,\" she said. \"But no one can stop us from combining our efforts. Of\ncourse, if this works, it will make us stronger competitors. But\nthis is certainly not about restricting trade in any way.\" Merkel said the development of the hedge fund sector would\nbe discussed during Germany's presidency of the G8. \"The result does not have to be new legislation. It can be\nself-regulation or improved supervision,\" she said. In the wide-ranging interview, Merkel said she was hopeful a\nproblem over a ban by Moscow of Polish meat imports would be\nsolved, enabling talks between the EU and Russia on a new\ncooperation pact to begin. \"I am very optimistic that we will solve the problem of\nPolish meat exports to Russia. Then we can start the\nnegotiations, although I am not saying they will be very easy.\" Merkel said Russia had the right to seek greater access to\nWestern European markets but that European investors should be\nequally able to enter Russian markets. \"If obstacles are being erected to protect Russian companies\nfrom European investors, nobody should resent it if the\nEuropeans take reciprocal action,\" she said. Merkel said no one should expect Germany's presidency to\nsolve the problems in the EU over adopting a constitution but\nshe aimed to develop a form of road map to move the process\nforward.\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/eu-us-merkel-idUSL0353271220070103", "sectors": [], "title": "update 3 - merkel seeks closer eu - us ties on economic issues"},

Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL.AX) and Santos Ltd. (STO.AX)\nsaid they planned to resume operations shortly after the\ncyclone passed the coast. Meteorologists said Isobel made\nlandfall about mid-afternoon local time. Woodside, Australia's top independent oil and gas company,\nsuspended production from its 100,000-bpd Cossack Pioneer field\nand 7,000-bpd Legendre field off the coast of Western Australia\non Tuesday evening,. Rival oil and gas producer Santos said it had shut\nproduction at its Mutineer-Exeter field. \"We are expecting to resume production by this afternoon\nand we should be back to full production tomorrow,\" Peter\nKermode, spokesman for Woodside, told Reuters. Operations at Legendre field, in which Apache Corp. (APA.N)\nand Santos also have stakes, was expected to resume later in\nthe week, Woodside said. Production capacity at the Mutineer-Exeter field was\nrecorded at 55,000 bdp at the end of the third quarter last\nyear. Tropical Cyclone Isobel was rated as a category one storm,\nthe lowest in a five-point scale, and has winds of up to 100\nkmh (62 mph) near its centre. Woodside's shares ended down 1.6 percent at A$37.68, while\nSantos' shares closed 1 percent lower at A$9.79 in an overall\nmarket down 0.4 percent. Woodside's Kermode said production at two other offshore\ngas platforms, North Rankin and Goodwyn, had not been affected\nby the cyclone. Cyclone Isobel revived memories of Cyclone Glenda, a\ndestructive category four storm, which forced oil and gas\nfields to shut down and thousands of people to take shelter\nwhen it hit the region last March. Australia's Bureau of Meteorology (www.bom.gov.au) said\nCyclone Isobel was expected to weaken below tropical cyclone\nstrength after it crossed the coast. But it warned that remnants of Cyclone Isobel were expected\nto produce \"widespread damaging and locally destructive winds\nand very heavy rainfall\" in southern districts of Western\nAustralia.

{"date": "01:52 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " By Dhara Ranasinghe SINGAPORE, Jan 3 The euro held firm against\nother major currencies on Wednesday, while sterling and the\nAustralian dollar extended gains on the back of strong appetite\nfor high-yielding plays. The euro EUR= stood at about $1.3286 in Asian trade after\nrising 0.6 percent on Tuesday, breaking resistance at $1.3245,\nand rose to 1.6141 Swiss francs EURCHF= -- the strongest\nlevel in almost seven years. It was at 157.77 yen EURJPY=, holding close to Tuesday's\nrecord peak at about 157.90. Traders said speculative buyers\nwere looking to break option barriers above 158.00. Carry trades, in which investors sell low-yielding\ncurrencies for high yielders, were expected to dominate trade\nas the new year got under way. \"Carry trades are definitely the focus in the market --\nliquidity conditions are still very ample and there is no\nreason why the carry trade is going to fall out of favour yet,\"\nsaid Sharada Selvanathan, a currency strategist at BNP Paribas. \"That explains why the European currencies are holding up\nquite well and also why the more high-yielding currencies like\nthe Aussie and Kiwi are also doing quite well.\" The European Central Bank is expected to raise borrowing\ncosts to 3.75 percent in coming months from the current 3.5. By\ncontrast, the next move on U.S. interest rates is likely to be\na cut from 5.25 percent after a steady policy in recent months. Japanese rates are seen rising at a very gradual pace from\n0.25 percent -- maintaining the euro's yield advantage. The yen remains the funding vehicle of choice for the carry\ntrade, ahead of the Swiss franc, said Peter Pontikis, a\ntreasury strategist at Suncorp. \"There's no political or bureaucratic consensus for a rate\nhike in Japan right now, so it seems safe to borrow in yen,\" he\nsaid. Funds borrowed in yen tend to end up in higher-yielding\ncurrencies such as sterling and the Australian and New Zealand\ndollars. The Australian dollar firmed to $0.7983 AUD=, its\nstrongest level since March 2005. A move above $0.7989 would\ntake the Aussie dollar to its highest since Feb. 2004.

Crane said he would continue as chairman and CEO following \nthe buyout of EGL, which provides services including air and \nocean freight forwarding and local delivery service.

{"date": "02:34 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - When watching the DVD re-release of \"Gone With the Wind,\" what once appeared as simply a green cloth shawl worn by Vivien Leigh is revealed as a garment of dark emerald velvet so rich it beckons touching.Similarly, in the 1939 film's opening scene, while Leigh's Scarlett O'Hara rambles on about the tedium of war, the white bodice of her dress now displays precise lace patterns and threads.Likewise, when Errol Flynn rides horseback into Sherwood Forest in 1938's \"The Adventures of Robin Hood,\" the detailed pattern embedded on his and other soldiers' armor is so vivid that the number of small metal rings can be counted.These elements have been made clearly visible through a patented technology created by Warner Bros. in collaboration with AOL. The process involves digitally realigning and sharpening the older film negatives of these classic movies shot on Technicolor three-strip film.Known as Ultra Resolution, the technique has been nominated this year for a Scientific and Technical Academy Award and has restored films in the studio's vast library including \"Singing In the Rain,\" \"The Searchers\" and \"The Wizard of Oz\" -- prints that over time have suffered blurring or \"color fringing\" as well as shrinkage, stretching and other damage.It was while observing a projected picture of \"Wind\" during some digital scanning that Chris Cookson, president, Warner Bros. Technical Operations and chief technology officer, Warner Bros. Entertainment, says he was inspired. He noticed a frame five pixels out of alignment and knew the resolution could be improved if somehow all the sharp edges could just be better matched.\"The purpose of Technicolor was to make color, not precise images,\" said Cookson, explaining that the Technicolor process used in the 1930s and '40s involved stacking together each frame of a negative to produce a full color print. \"In a sense, we're mining the film and audio elements that have been sitting on these prints all these years.\"The restoration process got a helping hand from the otherwise disastrous 2001 takeover of the studio's Time Warner parent by America Online. Two sisters who serve as heads of research and development at AOL, Keren and Sharon Perlmutter devised an algorithm to analyze each square block of a frame, detecting the edges of each original color record and adjusting the color alignment accordingly.Although Warner Bros. holds four patents on the technology with additional ones pending, the studio has shared the technique with other studios, recently being used to create a new negative for damaged scenes in Paramount's \"Chinatown.\"Cookson, who points to the fact that the technology can also be used to build a new negative rather than just restoring one, recounted the reaction of \"Singing\" director Stanley Donen when he was shown the digitally restored version of his 1952 film.\"It looks like it did that day on the stage,\" Cookson recalled Donen saying.For Cookson and those who worked tirelessly on the restoration of some of history's most classic films, the ultimate beneficiary is the film consumer.\"It not only benefits Warner Bros. and the industry at large, it benefits the movies themselves and the people who love them.\"Reuters/Hollywood Reporter", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-restore-idUSN0235764720070103", "sectors": [["Entertainment, ", "Film"]], "title": "new restoration brings movie classics to life"},

In the fourth-quarter, the median price of a home in \nManhattan rose 5.1 over the year-ago period, according to the \nreport, the Prudential Douglas Elliman Manhattan Market \nOverview. The number of sales during the fourth-quarter rose 15.5 \npercent to 2,441 from the prior quarter and 55 percent from the \nyear ago quarter. The inventory of homes shrunk 22.2 percent \nfrom the third quarter to 5,934 and 0.5 percent from the year \nago quarter. Sale prices slipped 5 percent to $1,187,404 in the fourth \nquarter from $1,288,748 in the third quarter 2006, but Miller \nattributed that to seasonality. The price drop has happened in \neach of the past 16 years, he noted. The average price per square foot fell 0.4 percent to $998 \nin the fourth quarter of '06. That was 5 percent below the \nthird quarter's $1,050 per square foot. Meanwhile, the median sales price, in which half the units \nsold were more expensive and half were less, rose 5.1 percent \nto $799,000 from $760,000 the prior year but was 5.5 percent \nbelow the third quarter 2006 median sales. Mortgage rates, which have held within a narrow band, and a \nstrong local economy have supported New York apartment prices. \nBut the market's blessing, Miller said, has been the lack of \nspeculators who bought with the intention to quickly sell. Such investors, bid up prices in other markets such as San \nDiego, California, Las Vegas, Nevada, and parts of Northern \nCalifornia and Florida, and then hurt the markets there when \nthey left, driving sales down in certain markets by as 50 \npercent. Dottie Herman, chief executive of residential brokerage \ncompany Prudential Douglas Elliman said New York apartment \nprices in 2007 could be as strong as prices seen in the boom \ntimes of 2004-2005 if inventory continues to decline, and Wall \nStreet bonuses get spent on apartments. \"If you see inventory going down any further, you're going \nsee what happened in 2004,\" Herman said. She was referring to \nthe 20-plus percent price hikes seen in much of 2004 and 2005. \"There was virtually no inventory then,\" she said. \"Right \nnow it looks healthy and balanced. You've got to watch now.\"", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/businesspro-apartments-new-york-dc-idUSN0235383620070103", "sectors": [["Bonds"]], "title": "manhattan apartment downturn short - lived : report"},

{"date": "03:25 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "PENANG, Malaysia The fate of China's last imperial dynasty was sealed in an unlikely place -- an indigo-blue shophouse jammed into a bustling commercial street on the Malaysian island of Penang.Here, early in the last century, Chinese revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen, shattered by the strain of leading nine failed rebellions against the country's crumbling Qing dynasty, broke down and begged discouraged supporters to aid him one last time.\"I will not trouble you again,\" historian Khoo Salma Nasution quoted the distraught 44-year-old as telling the Chinese migrant merchants who had funded his efforts.\"The rest was history,\" she added. \"The money raised from his supporters funded two rebellions in 1911, which overthrew the Manchu dynasty and made him China's first provisional president.\"Sun, the father of the revolution that toppled China's last emperor in 1911, died in 1925, and is a hero in China despite being the former leader of the Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party, defeated by the Communists in 1949.The 1910 meeting with his backers in Malaysia, known to history as the \"Penang Conference\", was held in utter secrecy in Sun's headquarters on Armenian Street, crowded round with secret society dens and temples built by migrant Chinese traders.Sun, a Western-educated physician exiled by the Qing government, plotted the Canton uprising from his base in the bustling then-British-controlled port of Penang on the west coast of colonial Malaya.Few traces of the dynamic leader remain, apart from an exhibition of photographs that commemorates his brief stay on the island, where Sun had sought refuge from the Manchu-dominated Chinese government.Yet the house, with its narrow passages, small courtyards, winding staircases and hidden rooms, bears powerful testimony to the secrecy that surrounded Sun's revolutionary activities.\"This was his life. It was always in the shadows,\" said Khoo, whose family has owned the house since it was bought in the 1930s by her grandfather, an arms dealer who wanted a place to store his stock.HERITAGE CONSERVATION NETWORKNow, almost a century later, Khoo's shophouse serves a different purpose as the home of the Lestari Heritage Network, which runs a program of heritage conservation projects around Asia, as well as a publishing firm, to document its activities.The network, run by Khoo, has helped fund efforts to restore heritage buildings in former mercantile and colonial centers in India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Thailand.Agencies such as the Japan Foundation and the New York-based Institute for Cultural Enterprise have helped provide the funds.\"Sun Yat-sen used the shophouse as a base for his revolutionary activities,\" said Khoo. \"We are coming full circle with the shophouse as a center for heritage conservation.She added, \"My family thought I was crazy to spend so much money and effort to restore the shophouse. But they now realize this shophouse could have been lost forever if nothing was done.\"She declined to say how much she had invested in the project.Her efforts have paid off.China officially recognized the site when President Hu Jin Tao visited the shophouse in 2002 and presented a commemorative plaque to Khoo. At the time, Hu was China's vice-president.But other sites in Penang associated with Sun have slowly begun to disappear. Sun's house, located in a different part of Georgetown, has long since been demolished.Sun held secret gatherings in Penang to spread his ideas about overthrowing the Qing dynasty and canvassing for funds.He was able to tap into the sentiments of the vibrant Chinese migrant community, which was bitterly upset over news that their home country had been ravaged by famine and torn apart by civil war and clashing warlords.\"These buildings can piece together Sun's Malaysia story but they face an uncertain future,\" said Khoo, lamenting that agencies of the state and federal government had shown little interest in conservation efforts in Georgetown.\"People here are slow to realize that Penang has such links to international history. It is a shame.\"But one proof of Sun's presence in Penang still lives on, in the form of a Chinese newspaper launched in the shophouse for distribution among his supporters.Today, the paper, which features Sun's calligraphy in its masthead, is Malaysia's longest-running Chinese daily with a circulation of up to 72,000 in 2005.\"Sun Yat-sen knew how to move the hearts and pockets of the overseas Chinese with his speeches,\" Khoo said. \"The newspaper brought it to another level. Now, that's all we in Malaysia have of him.\"", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-malaysia-china-revolutionary-idUSKLR3439920070103", "sectors": [], "title": "chinese hero ' s memory burns bright in penang house"},

{"date": "01:57 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "SINGAPORE Jan 3 Stocks in Hong Kong, Australia\nand Singapore hit record highs on Wednesday as investors bet\nthere was room to build on last year's rally while the\nAustralian dollar extended gains as dealers bought\nhigh-yielding currencies. Gold and oil were little changed but activity was subdued\nwith many traders still away on holiday or awaiting minutes due\nlater on Wednesday of the last U.S. Federal Reserve meeting for\npotential clues on the outlook for interest rates and the\ndollar. Markets were also waiting for the Institute for Supply\nManagement's latest reading on U.S. manufacturing, due to be\nreleased later in the day, to help determine market direction. Britain's FTSE 100 index .FTSE was seen opening down 2 to\n14 points after gaining 1.45 percent on Tuesday. \"Look at the liquidity in the market,\" said Dale Tsang,\nmanaging director, securities trading division, Polaris Capital\n(Asia) Limited in Hong Kong. \"Corrections may happen here and there, but generally this\nwill continue to be a bull market.\" Hong Kong's Hang Seng index .HSI rose 1.2 percent to a\nrecord high of 20,554.58, before retreating to end the morning\nup 0.21 percent. Gains were helped by strength in heavyweight\nChina Mobile (0941.HK), the world's largest mobile phone\ncarrier, and as a market holiday in mainland China encouraged\nfund inflows. Australian shares .AXJO ended 0.4 percent lower after\nhitting a fifth straight record peak as investors snapped up\nlast year's laggard BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP.AX) on expectations\nof continued strong demand for metals. Oil companies weighed on the index late in the session as\nan approaching cyclone forced some firms to halt some\nproduction off the coast of Western Australia. In Southeast Asia, Singapore's Straits Times Index .STI\ntopped the 3,000 level for the first time, gaining 1.3 percent\nled by banks and property stocks after the city-state posted\nhigher-than-expected figures for fourth-quarter economic\ngrowth. But Thai shares .SETI tumbled nearly 3 percent to a\n2-week low as investors had their first chance to react to New\nYear's Eve bombings in Bangkok after market holidays. Big cap\nshares suffered most on fears of new political uncertainty with\nthe country's biggest energy firm, PTT (PTT.BK) losing 2.9\npercent. INVESTORS SEEK YIELD Japanese financial markets remained closed for the New\nYear's holiday but will reopen on Thursday for a half day of\ntrade. The euro held firm against the U.S. dollar and the yen and\nhit a near seven-year high against the Swiss franc. Sterling\nand the Australian dollar extended gains against the U.S.\ndollar due to strong appetite for high-yielding currencies. Sterling rose to a one-month high of $1.9749 GBP=, with\nexpectations of another rise in British interest rates early\nthis year supporting the currency. The Australian dollar firmed\nto $0.7983 AUD=, its strongest level since March 2005 and\nreached almost a decade high against the yen . The U.S. dollar eased to 118.71 yen JPY= from 118.85 late\nin New York, but the holiday in Tokyo kept trading thin. The euro EUR= was quoted at $1.3284 in Asian trade after\nrising 0.6 percent on Tuesday, breaking resistance at $1.3245\nin the process. It was at 157.75 yen EURJPY=, close to\nTuesday's record peak at about 157.90. The euro also traded as\nhigh as 1.6141 Swiss francs EURCHF=, its highest in almost\nseven years. Spot gold XAU= fetched $640.40 an ounce, barely changed\nfrom $640.10/641.10 late in London on Tuesday, when the metal\njumped to its highest in nearly a month at $640.80 on a weaker\ndollar. \"I think it's going to be a good quarter. There's nothing\nmuch to say for today with the Japanese still away for a\nholiday. But if you ask me where we are going for the year,\ngenerally I will play it up,\" said a dealer in Singapore. \"I think $540 will be a key support level. We should be\nfine as long as we don't break that level and generally people\nare buoyant. There's a lot of liquidity around and this points\nto inflation,\" he said.  Oil prices were little changed just below $61 a barrel as\nmild weather was forecast to persist in the United States,\nreducing heating oil demand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/markets-global-idUSSP5179320070103", "sectors": [], "title": "global markets - hk stocks hit record high , aussie dollar rules"},

They realize that we can't do anything to help them, but they might be able to prevent the same thing happening to others,\" he said.SHOCKING STORIESAustralia has welcomed around half a million refugees since 1945, but takes a tougher line with asylum seekers who try to enter the country illegally. Around 4,000 sought entry each year between 2000 and 2003 and under government policy were detained in remote processing camps, with many later deported.The stories of those sent back are often shocking, says Glendenning, citing Iraqi asylum seeker Mohammed Sharif al-Saraf, a Shi'ite, who was allowed to stay in Australia for three years until 2004 but was then sent home to Iraq and killed in Baghdad after being accused of being an Australian spy.Al-Saraf, who left a wife and two children in Iran, had been assured by Australian authorities that he was no longer in danger in Iraq after the removal of Saddam Hussein's government.Then there was an Afghan man from the minority Hazara ethnic group who Glendenning will not name, whose daughters, aged six and nine, were killed when their home was bombed in a country Canberra had promised would be safe.Australia's Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in 2000 asked Prime Minister John Howard's conservative government to monitor those deported or sent home with A$2,000 repatriation payment to ensure their safety.In the face of official reluctance, the Edmund Rice Center has interviewed 85 former asylum seekers in 25 countries, and has spoken to upwards of 250 people about their experiences.The center, funded by public donations, verifies stories with the United Nations, Human Rights Watch and other rights groups, compiling them into published reports.But those stories have not been well received by the government, which says it has no mandate to follow up on returned asylum seekers.\"Australia has no right to monitor a person after their departure from Australia and arrival in their home country,\" a spokesman for Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone said.He said refugees to Australia were selected on the basis on need and recommendations by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\"Despite repeated requests, the Edmund Rice Center has been unable or unwilling to provide the government with sufficient information to allow its allegations to be properly examined,\" the spokesman said.Glendenning said the government, which faces an election in late 2007 after 10 years in power, is unwilling to listen to stories which contradict its approach.SMALL TRIUMPHSThe center has racked up what it regards as fleeting triumphs. As a result of Edmund Rice interviews, some refugees have resettled in Canada and New Zealand and an Angolan man is now working in London as a bricklayer.Glendenning said their stories are remarkably similar and if their tales of mistreatment are lies, then they are lies which somehow span the globe.\"There's either a rocket-size conspiracy or a case to be answered,\" he said.But the search for Australia's rejected asylum seekers is not without dangers. In Kabul, Glendenning was forced to talk his way out of jail with World Cup football stories after having guns placed against his head and chest.\"The point is we can get out, and we can just go to the airport and get on a plane. The people that we send back cannot,\" he said.Australia's long reputation as a country of opportunity and equality for newcomers who make up 25 percent of the country's 20 million population may have also been put at risk.\"I wear a New Zealand football jersey half the time I'm in the Middle East, because Australia is extraordinarily unpopular,\" said Glendenning.\"One upon a time if you were an Australian overseas it was a passport to being embraced and welcomed, but I think our policies have deeply changed that.\"($1=A$1.27)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-australia-asylum-idUSSP15967920070103", "sectors": [], "title": "australian rights warriors hunt refugee rejects"},

The bombs were probably the work of militants from the far south,\" he said in the handwritten letter. \"I want to condemn the group that was behind the bombs in the strongest terms.\"More than 1,800 people have been killed in three years of violence in the three southernmost provinces abutting Malaysia.But the militants, who have not made their aims public and do not issue claims of responsibility, have never taken their campaign beyond the immediate region, a move that would represent a major escalation.Security analysts said that even though there were some similarities between the types of bombs used, the wide geographical spread of the New Year blasts across the capital was markedly different from serial bomb attacks in the south.\"This has to be in some fashion linked to the former regime -- but that's such an enormous pool of people,\" said security analyst Brian Dougherty of Hill and Associates in Bangkok.CONSPIRACY THEORIESSurayud Chulanont, Thaksin's army-appointed successor, said on Monday that intelligence pointed to politicians who had lost power -- but added that that did not mean only Thaksin.He did not reveal any details of the intelligence and admitted the government did not know who ordered the bombings.\"Briefs from various intelligence agencies, based on evidence available, show that they came from groups that have lost political powers,\" Surayud told a news conference on Monday.\"These were not just the previous government, but include all those which have lost power in the past,\" he said. \"We could not at this stage pinpoint which particular group was involved.\"General Saprang Kalayanamitr, the most outspoken member of the Council for National Security (CNS), as the coup leaders call themselves, said the bombs were a clear attempt to destabilize the country.\"I can assure you that it's not rebels from the far south. This is because of the people who previously held power,\" he told a Bangkok radio station. \"They want to show that this government is failing to manage the country.\"The confusion of messages from the army, police and government has triggered a rash of conspiracy theories.Among them are police seeking to head off an army-imposed reform drive, a renegade former prime minister acting in a fit of pique, or hardline elements in the army looking for excuses to perpetuate military rule.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-thailand-bombs-idUSBKK13895920070103", "sectors": [["World"]], "title": "ousted thai pm denies any links to bangkok bombs"},
{"date": "04:30 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Jasmila Zbanic vividly recalls when war broke out in her native Sarajevo. She was just 17 years old, the daughter of two economists, both sophisticated professionals who found it inconceivable that the West would stand by as their country was transformed into a laboratory for \"ethnic cleansing.\"When the violence erupted in 1992, \"I was extremely happy because I had exams in mathematics -- so I didn't have to go to school!\" Zbanic remembers. \"We only realized very late what was happening. We knew a war was going on, but we thought we were so ethnically mixed, it was not possible for it to reach us here (in Sarajevo). Even when the shelling began, we thought Europe and the world would not allow this to happen.\"Overnight, Sarajevo was divided: Half of the city was overrun by Serbian forces, the other half trapped by a blockade that made the most basic necessities of life -- food, water, clothing -- seem like unimaginable luxuries. \"Sarajevo was surrounded by the Serbian army, and part of it was taken,\" Zbanic says. \"I could look down from my window across the river and see the part of the city they had turned into a concentration camp.\"It was precisely those experiences that Zbanic drew from for her new film, Strand Releasing's \"Grbavica\" (pronounced Grr-bah-vee-zah), about a wartime rape victim struggling to escape her memories years after the war has ended.In addressing her country's traumatic past, Zbanic is one of many international directors who have chosen to focus on what is unique about their societies, telling stories about things so culturally specific they could only originate from a native voice. It's an elite group of films that includes Turkey's \"Ice Cream, I Scream\"; Egypt's \"Yacoubian Building\"; Italy's turn-of-the-last-century tale, \"The Golden Door\" from Miramax; Denmark's family drama, IFC Films' \"After the Wedding\"; France's \"Avenue Montaigne\" from ThinkFilm and Brazil's rural road-trip feature, Global Film Initiative's \"Cinema, Aspirins and Vultures,\" among others.CULTURAL VARIATIONS\"The Americans are doing American films perfectly,\" says Yuksel Aksu, director of \"Ice Cream,\" a comedy about a small-time ice cream salesman struggling to keep his business open. \"If we imitate them, then we won't be able to create our own cinema. I wanted to make a film that belongs to this country, this geography and this culture.\"That doesn't mean I don't like American movies or I am against them,\" he continues.\"I really follow them, but even with their influences, I wanted to make a very different kind of film, a film about what is in our culture.\"Marwan Hamed, director of \"Building,\" a multicharacter story about the rich and poor inhabitants of an old Cairo building, also aimed to make a movie unique to his culture -- though he admits that the economics of the global film industry are making that more and more difficult.\"You don't usually get the chance to do this kind of work because the industry itself is always (in favor of) the Hollywood pattern,\" he says. \"Most of the films we do in Egypt have this Hollywood flavor to them. Of course, they are not as big as Hollywood, but they imitate those films. I am always trying to do things the Egyptian way.\"What he means by \"the Egyptian way\" is the subject of debate. \"Building\" openly addresses issues of sexual harassment, police brutality, political corruption and homosexuality -- as well as the matter of how a likable young man gets drawn into Islamic extremism. Opponents fought to have the film suppressed, and there was even a parliamentary debate about whether the movie should be banned because of its controversial subject matter.FRENCH HEROESSimilarly, the Franco-Algerian \"Days of Glory,\" from IFC Films/The Weinstein Co., created a political stir in France, where its director, Rachid Bouchareb, lives and found financing for his $18 million movie. The film centers on the experiences of Africans who fought for France during World War II but were then treated as second-class citizens by its government -- an issue many French citizens have chosen to ignore.The son of Algerian immigrants growing up in the suburbs of Paris, Bouchareb was influenced by his own background. \"We all know racism and discrimination when we are the children of immigrants, even today,\" he says. \"In my film, I wanted to say that our ancestors didn't just come to France to work but were also heroes of the French liberation. Instead of painting a largely negative portrait of us -- that of economic immigrants -- this film shows that these Muslims died on French soil, defending France when she was occupied by Germany and the Nazis, fighting for it to be free.\"Conservative presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy attacked Bouchareb for his film and its political viewpoint. \"Sarkozy said it didn't interest anyone in France, which is wrong because 3 million people have seen it already,\" Bouchareb says.But the filmmaker says \"Days\" has had an impact beyond the box office: In late November, the French parliament voted to give Algerian soldiers the same pension as French soldiers, a radical change in policy and something those original African fighters would have found unimaginable.SICILIAN SAGAAlthough Emanuele Crialese, director of Italy's \"Door,\" faced none of the political challenges of Bouchareb in making his film, he, too, was drawn to his nation's past and was driven to tell the story of Sicilian emigrants who set out for a better life in America. The idea for the project came to him while he was studying film at NYU.Crialese remembers being deeply affected by photographs of immigrants from around the world that he saw during a trip to Ellis Island. \"I looked at these pictures, and I was very moved by the look of the new arrivals,\" he recalls. \"I saw many women disembarking, completely lost. After that, I went back to Ellis Island every day for two months.\"Crialese was especially moved by the gulf between the immigrants' lives and the way they would describe their lives in letters home. \"They would all write back to their families (that) the roads were shining like gold,\" he says. \"There were some families that worked in factories; they were working 20 hours a day. But they would write that the machine was doing all the work. It didn't matter what they were going through -- they always said America was beautiful.\"MONEY MATTERSA different kind of emigrant experience is chronicled in Susanne Bier's \"Wedding.\" The film centers on an idealistic man in his 40s who has been living in India but returns to his native Denmark in order to raise money for an orphanage. He soon discovers that the wealthy man who has summoned him home has a hidden agenda.Attitudes toward wealth and class are particularly compelling in Europe, where, Bier says, perception does not always match reality. \"In Europe, there is this prejudice against wealthy people, that they are not very nice,\" she says. \"In a way, the prejudice is correct to a point -- but only to a point -- and that became really interesting to me.\"One of the points of the movie is opposing that prejudice,\" she adds. \"To create that sort of wealth often means being unscrupulous and cynical, but it also takes being really intelligent and visionary. That mixture within a character is extremely interesting and somewhat frightening.\"Wealth -- or the lack thereof -- also plays a key role in Brazil's \"Cinema, Aspirins and Vultures.\" Helmer Marcelo Gomes turned to his great uncle's memories for this story of an unlikely coupling between a Brazilian peasant and the German adventurer who hires him, a latter-day hippie fleeing his country at the beginning of World War II, who travels around northern Brazil in a battered truck, screening a worn-out piece of 16mm film promoting the wonders of aspirin.Gomes recalls of his great uncle: \"There were so many dry seasons; he said, 'I am going to go to the south of Brazil because there is more development there.' And on his way, he met this German guy who was selling aspirins to nowhere places and needed help, so my great uncle went to work for him. Then, in the middle of their trip, Brazil declared war against Germany, and they closed the aspirin factories and said to the German guy (that) he had to go back. This German was kind of a hippie; he said, 'I am not going to go back just to kill people.' Instead, he decided to go to the Amazon, while my great uncle went to Rio de Janeiro. He never heard anything about him again.\"If the real-life basis of Gomes' film gives it a certain authenticity, so does his decision to shoot in the poverty-stricken north and also to use locals in small parts. Many in this remote section of the country had never seen a movie camera before. \"There is one old man who sells food in a restaurant in the film, and he had never seen a camera or a cinema in his life,\" he remembers. \"After we shot, I said, 'Was it difficult?' He said, 'It is easy to be an actor, but it is difficult to be a peasant in Brazil.' That local color impregnated our film.\"Reuters/Hollywood Reporter", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-directors-idUSN0336131720070103", "sectors": [["Entertainment, ", "Film"]], "title": "foreign filmmakers inspired by injustice at home"},

Strong growth in 2006 has helped send the Singapore dollar \nSGD= to its highest level against the U.S. dollar in nearly a \ndecade and the Singapore stock market .STI to record highs. The government has made a big effort to diversify the \neconomy in the face of competition from low-cost countries such \nas China and Vietnam, spending billions to develop a biotech \npipeline and promoting everything from private banking to \neducation to tourism. Two huge casinos set to open by 2010 are expected to help \ndouble tourist arrivals to 17 million a year and triple tourism \nreceipts to S$30 billion ($19.6 billion) by 2015. Economists say the formula has helped Singapore reduce some \nof its dependence on tech exports, long the lifeline of its \neconomic expansion. \"The broad-based growth in 2006 was a reflection of the \nhealthy global economy which is ultimately key for Singapore,\" \nsaid David Cohen, an economist at Action Economics. \"We saw the \nlong-awaited turnaround in construction and services remain \nhealthy as well.\" The island-state drew a record number of tourists in 2006 \nand created its highest number of new jobs ever.\n SLOWER GROWTH Solid end-year output in the manufacturing sector, which \nmakes up about a quarter of gross domestic product (GDP), gave \na big boost to the economy in the fourth quarter. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.9 percent in the \nquarter from a year earlier, compared with expectations of a \n5.5 percent expansion and following a revised 7.0 percent \ngrowth in the third quarter. Most analysts have forecast slower, albeit still healthy, \ngrowth this year, with regional and domestic demand helping to \noffset any big slowdown in the United States. However, in Singapore's property sector some high-end homes \nare selling at prices not seen since before the financial \ncrisis in 1997/98, and wages in certain sectors are jumping \nhigher. Against that background, Singapore's central bank is \nexpected to maintain its policy of a gradual, modest \nappreciation in the Singapore dollar SGD=. The central bank \nconducts monetary policy through the currency rather than \ninterest rates. After Wednesday's data, the Singapore dollar was largely \nunchanged at 1.5304/09 per US dollar.

Neither did Chicago, another city seen as a potential target.The report ranked Chicago in the early stages of communications development and cited political divisions between the city and surrounding Cook County as the reason.The inability of police and fire officials to communicate during the September 11 attacks was blamed for the deaths of New York City firefighters despite a police warning when the World Trade Center towers began to collapse.The September 11 commission, which investigated the attacks, recommended \"interoperability\" of the communications systems of urban emergency services.The new Homeland Security report said 75 urban and metropolitan areas have policies governing interoperability. But it said leadership and planning have lagged and emergency services in some areas were still in need of regular training.Homeland Security awarded most-advanced status to areas that have standard procedures for interoperable communications, proven familiarity with the equipment during emergencies and a strategic plan for meeting further communications goals.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-security-usa-cities-idUSN0235751920070103", "sectors": [["U.S."]], "title": "only four big u . s . cities ready for crisis : report"},

Needless to say, the money has been confiscated and will be put to better use.\"The MEND said such plans endangered the lives of the hostages as their guards had orders to shoot them if any attempt was made to release them without authorization.Attacks on oil facilities and abductions of foreign oil workers have plagued the Niger Delta for years, but the violence worsened in 2006 and is expected to escalate further in the build-up to Nigeria's general elections in April.Nigeria, an OPEC member and the world's eighth-biggest exporter of crude, gets all its oil from the Niger Delta but the vast, impoverished region of mangrove-lined creeks and swamps has long been neglected by the central and local governments.Poverty and frustration at an industry that creates few jobs while polluting the environment fuel militancy and crime.FACELESS GROUPThe MEND, a faceless group which emerged in late 2005, launched a series of raids on oil facilities last February which shut down over 500,000 bpd of oil output -- a fifth of Nigeria's oil production capacity. That output has yet to resume.The MEND captured dozens of expatriates during a series of sophisticated raids in January and February last year. All were released unharmed on undisclosed terms after up to five weeks.Kidnappings for ransom are common in the Niger Delta, but after the latest abductions the MEND said it did not want money for the four hostages. Instead, it reiterated demands for the release of two jailed leaders from the Niger Delta and compensation by companies to residents for oil spills.Since the December 7 abductions, the MEND has also detonated three car bombs in the delta's main city, Port Harcourt, prompting oil majors Shell and Total to pull out hundreds of relatives of their expatriate staff.The MEND said on Tuesday that Roberto Dieghi, one of the Italian hostages, was suffering from various ailments and it would allow doctors from the humanitarian organization Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Doctors Without Borders, to visit him.The MSF head of mission in Port Harcourt said the group had not been contacted by anyone from the MEND.The MEND said on Sunday that it had moved the four hostages after discovering that a local government official had managed to smuggle a mobile phone to them.

(F.N) to the No. \n2 spot in the U.S. auto market in December for the third time \nin 2006, analysts said. Automakers release their December sales results on \nWednesday. Toyota, which is expected again to grow faster than all the \nother automakers, passed Ford in U.S. sales for the first time \nin July and again in November. Most analysts expect Ford sales to slip between 13 percent \nand 17 percent in December. \"The decrease is mostly a result of tough year end \ncompetition coupled with a weak product cadence,\" Merrill Lynch \nanalyst John Murphy said in a note to investors on Friday. \nMurphy estimates Ford will lose 1.2 percentage points of market \nshare in 2006. Calyon Securities analyst Joseph Amaturo said on Friday \nthat Ford's December sales would drop in part because it \nstopped producing the Taurus sedan, once the top-selling car in \nthe United States. Also, truck sales will likely decline during the month, \nhitting Ford hard because its F-Series trucks are the top- \nselling vehicles in that segment, analysts said. General Motors Corp. (GM.N) sales are expected to be down \nas much as 2 percent in December, while sales for \nDaimlerChrysler AG's DCXGn.DE Chrysler unit are expected to \nfall about 2 percent, according to analysts. \"The reason for the softness we are seeing is that October \nand November comps were so easy because of the pull-ahead \ncreated by summer discounts,\" IRN Inc. analyst Erich Merkle \nsaid last week. \"But December last year started a recovery. Next year, \ncomps are going to get much more difficult. You are going to \nsee some pretty dramatic declines on a percentage basis.\" The combined monthly U.S. market share for Detroit's Big \nThree is estimated to be 54.3 percent in December, down from \n56.6 percent a year earlier and up slightly from 53.2 percent \nlast month, according to Edmunds.com, which tracks the \nindustry. New U.S vehicle sales for December are expected to be a \nseasonally adjusted annual rate of between 16.5 million and \n16.8 million vehicles, according to analysts. That would be \ndown from last December's 17.1 million vehicle rate and an \nincrease from the 16 million rate posted in November. Both GM and Ford have launched year-end incentives to boost \nsales. Both programs, which run through January 2, offer cash \nincentives. Ford's program also includes interest-free \nfinancing for up to 60 months on some 2006 vehicles.\n WINNERS OF '06 Toyota is the big winner in 2006 with sales up 12.5 percent \nthrough November. Analysts expect the Japanese automaker to be \nup about 12 percent in December. \"Toyota should be the strongest foreign (automaker) in \nDecember, as its year-over-year sales should benefit from its \npopular, fuel-efficient small and mid-sized passenger cars as \nwell as its typical year-end sales event,\" Calyon's Amaturo \nsaid. Asian automakers gained in 2006 because customers preferred \nsmaller SUVs and cars over larger gas-guzzling sport utility \nvehicles, partly due to high gasoline prices. Toyota, Nissan Motor Co.

With what diplomats in the region assume was tacit U.S. blessing, its tanks, jets and troops overwhelmed the Islamists in two weeks.\"Washington encouraged Addis Ababa to go ahead. They provided the same sort of diplomatic cover they did for Israel going into Lebanon last summer, and for similar reasons -- to keep a foothold in the region,\" said analyst Michael Weinstein.\"Ordinary Americans are fed up with foreign interventions. So what's happened in Somalia is now going to be a preferred strategy -- using allies in the region as their catapult,\" said Weinstein, a politics professor at Indiana's Purdue University.Western military sources say the United States gave Ethiopia intelligence and surveillance help to accelerate its victory.Both Washington and Addis Ababa had portrayed the Islamists as linked to and even run by al Qaeda, putting Somalia firmly on the map of the U.S.-led global \"war on terror\".Yet President George W. Bush, haunted by such moments as his premature declaration of victory in Iraq in 2003, and his Africa policy-makers are unlikely to be crowing victory quickly.Some analysts predict the Islamists, who fled rather than take heavy casualties, could regroup and fight an Iraq-style insurgency from remote corners of Somalia, or carry out bomb attacks elsewhere in east Africa.\"The parallels with Iraq are unsettling,\" said Nairobi-based Somalia expert Matt Bryden.There is no guarantee of peace and harmony in Somalia now that six months of Islamist sharia rule are over.Indeed, the rapid return of warlords to Mogadishu shows how easily it could slide back into the anarchy and chaos it has suffered since dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted in 1991.\"The Americans have learned enough in Somalia not to run up a 'mission accomplished' banner,\" Bryden said. \"There probably is great relief in Washington ... The Ethiopian offensive was successful, civilian casualties were not too many. But there is no room for complacency.\"SOLDIERS KILLEDAmericans with good memories know that only too well.A disastrous attempt by U.S. forces to pacify Somalia in the early 1990s began with marines crawling up the beaches of Mogadishu in full combat gear, only to find a phalanx of waiting Western journalists rather than a hostile army.It ended with a humiliating withdrawal after Somali militias shot down two U.S. helicopters, killed 18 soldiers and dragged their bodies through the streets.\"...the (American) public would not have tolerated an overt intervention again,\" a European diplomat said. \"It's worked out ok for the Americans after the mess they first made.\"Early last year, Washington was vilified in east African diplomatic circles for secretly sending money to Mogadishu warlords who promised to catch \"terrorists.\"That fueled popular resentment against the warlords, who ran Mogadishu via checkpoints and extortion, and gave the Islamists a perfect rallying cry to rise up and take the city.So a chastened Washington came full circle -- from firing the shots in Somalia more than a decade ago, to manipulating events behind the scenes in the two-week war just ended.The U.S. challenge now is to help the Somali government broaden its clan base and popular support to become a truly national authority once Ethiopia withdraws its forces, Somali experts say.\"All Somalis have a role to play in the future of Somalia, except those who are committed to terrorism and violence,\" Michael Ranneberger, U.S. ambassador for Kenya and Somalia, said in a statement. \"Warlordism and clannism have no role to play in the future of a modern Somali state.\"The Somali government could cement its ties with the United States by handing over three top terrorism suspects the U.S. believes are hiding in Somalia. U.S. officials tried with no success to persuade the Somalia Islamic Courts Council (SICC) to give up the three -- wanted for 1998 bomb attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania -- during its short-lived rule.\"The Somali government is going to need all the help it can get,\" Weinstein said. \"So of course it would be useful to portray itself as a partner in the war on terror.\"", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-somalia-conflict-usa-idUSL0186209420070103", "sectors": [], "title": "ethiopia gives u . s . a new year ' s gift in somalia"},

Domestic consumption generates about half of economic activity while tourism accounts for 6 percent.The stock index .SETI closed down 3.03 percent at 659.25 points in the exchange's first day of trade since the blasts. It fell as much as 3.93 percent to 653.14 points in early trade, its lowest since December 20.The bombs, which the military-installed government blamed on former politicians while admitting it had no clear idea who ordered them, killed three people, wounded 38, including nine foreigners, and ruined New Year celebrations.How the government handled the problem would be a major factor in how long the impact of the bombs on the financial markets lasted, said Asia Plus Securities (ASP.BK) chief executive Kongkiat Opaswongkarn.\"It's too early to say that the impact would be short term as all eyes are now focusing on the government's unfoldings of the situation,\" he said as several bomb scares jangled nerves further.\"Of course, the baht will automatically be weakened as the authorities have imposed unfriendly measures to curb the baht,\" Kongkiat said of the central bank's imposition of some capital controls last month to restrain the currency's rise.The baht, Asia's fastest-rising currency against the dollar last year with an almost 14 percent rise, was trading at 35.90/36.00 baht per dollar, down from 35.46 late on Tuesday.BONDS MIXEDBond yields <0#THTSY=> on the secondary market were mixed, with long yields rising due to greater supply, but trade was thin as many investors were still away from the market, dealers said.Bid yields on two-year bonds THLB09NC= fell 5 basis points (bps), but five-year bond yields THLB123A= rose 9 bps to 5.2 percent. Twelve-year bond yields THLB19DA= rose 2 bps to 5.57 percent.Dealers said the bombs might draw investors into shifting to debt paper if stocks continued to perform poorly.Among big cap shares, PTT (PTT.BK), Thailand's biggest energy firm, fell 2.9 percent to 204 baht.Siam Cement (SCC.BK), the biggest industrial conglomerate, was 3.3 percent lower at 234 baht, while Advanced Info Service ADVA.BK, the leading mobile phone firm, dropped 1.9 percent to 76 baht.Shares in tourism-related firms also suffered.National carrier Thai Airways (THAI.BK) sank 7.9 percent to 40.75 baht, airport operator Airports of Thailand (AOT.BK) fell 5.1 percent to 55.5 baht and hotelier Minor International (MINT.BK) tumbled 8.4 percent to 10.9 baht.The bomb scares also hit department store shares. Central Pattana (CPN.BK), the country's biggest retail store operator, fell almost 8 percent to 20.8 baht.Hypermarket chain operator Big C Supercenter (BIGC.BK), 63 percent owned by French supermarket operator Casino Group (CASP.PA), fell 3.2 percent to 46 baht and Robinson Department Store ROBI.BK was 1.8 percent lower at 11 baht.Concern about domestic turmoil would continue to push foreign investors away despite the Thai stock market's cheap valuation, analysts said.The Bangkok bourse was trading at 8 times price to earnings ratio compared with 13-16 times of other Southeast Asian markets.\"The market will obviously be bearish in the short-to-medium term with continued foreign fund outflows largely because we have too many problems right now,\" Warut of Globlex Securities said.The Thai bourse ended 2006 as Asia's worst-performing major index, down 4.75 percent after shock currency controls triggered a foreign-led sell-off late in the year.Months of street protests which ended with the ouster of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in a bloodless September 19 coup also made 2006 a turbulent year for Thai stocks.The shock capital controls imposed on December 18, which drove the stock index down nearly 15 percent, were aimed at slowing the baht's surge but sent many foreign investors rushing for the door.Foreign investors ended the year net buyers of Thai shares worth 83 billion baht ($2.3 billion), compared with net purchases of shares worth 118.8 billion baht in 2005.\"The index could come under pressure for months as foreign investors seek opportunity to switch their portfolio to lower risk markets such as the Philippines, or Hong Kong,\" Siam City Securities analyst Sukit Udomsirikul said.(Additional reporting by Orathai Sriring)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-markets-thailand-stocks-idUSBKK00017320070103", "sectors": [["Asian Markets"]], "title": "thai stocks fall as bombs jangle nerves"},

The lawsuit filed on Friday in a Fort Lauderdale, Florida, \ncourt alleges that leaders of the Seminole's gambling business \nmet with Hard Rock executives to prepare offers months before \nRank last July announced it wanted to sell the Hard Rock Cafe \nInternational restaurants, hotels and entertainment venues. \"Defendants participated in collusion and bid rigging with \nrespect to offers to purchase Hard Rock from Rank,\" the lawsuit \nsaid. Lawyers for Cordish said their executives and bankers had \nbeen repeatedly refused offering documents for the auction and \nbeen barred from participating in the deal. The lawsuit also said Cordish had made an all-cash offer to \nRank for Hard Rock in 2005 and that the Hard Rock's managers \nhad been fearful of dismissal during any Cordish takeover. \nSenior managers will remain after the Seminole transaction. The lawsuit named as defendants Hard Rock Cafe \nInternational (USA) Inc., the unit's chief executive, Hamish \nDodds, and Seminole Hard Rock Entertainment Inc., and also \nasked for unspecified financial damages. A spokesman for the Seminole tribe in Hollywood, Florida, \nwas not immediately available to comment on the allegations and \nthe lawsuit. A spokesman for Hard Rock declined to comment.

Carry plays, using low-yielding currencies such as the yen\nto fund purchases of units with more attractive interest rates,\nwere the major factor behind the euro's pulse higher, analysts\nsaid. \"What we're seeing on euro/yen is pretty much a continuation\nof the themes from the end of last year -- the theme of carry is\nstill very much in place,\" BNP Paribas senior currency\nstrategist Ian Stannard said.

The number of unemployed people in Germany fell by a much\nbigger than expected 108,000 in seasonally adjusted terms in\nDecember, Federal Labour Office figures showed.

Fed officials have been talking tough on inflation even as\nthe market wagered on rate cuts and dollar bears will be looking\nfor any hint of a softer tone. The Institute for Supply Management's December reading on\nthe U.S. manufacturing sector is also due, while Friday brings\nthe non-farm payrolls report for December. A reading below 50 in the ISM index, which dipped below the\nboom-or-bust level for the first time in three-and-a-half years\nin November, would reinforce concerns about an economic\nslowdown. \"The ISM is going to be really key at this stage.

Other U.S. data due on Wednesday includes the ADP December\nemployment report, often seen as a precursor to Friday's\npayrolls data. \n CARRY STILL KING Sterling and the Australian dollar benefited alongside the\neuro, extending recent gains as carry trades targeting\nhigh-yielders dominated activity. \"Arguably the market enters 2007 very long the carry trade,\nwith risk appetite strong and little incentive to fight the low\nvolatility rallies in many high yielding currencies. We are not\nbrave enough to recommend going against the carry trade just\nyet,\" ING analyst Chris Turner said in a note to clients. The European Central Bank is expected to raise borrowing\ncosts to 3.75 percent in coming months from the current 3.5. By\ncontrast, the next move on U.S. interest rates is likely to be a\ncut from 5.25 percent after a steady policy in recent months.

The Foundation said in the document seen by Reuters that it is acting on behalf of the University of Washington, which owns the patents in question.The Foundation claims the three firms have sold handsets and devices in the United States using CSR's Bluetooth chips which use technology that infringe the University's radio frequency receiver patents.The patents have already been licensed to CSR's rival Broadcom (BRCM.O).\"Defendants have manufactured, used, imported into the United States, sold and offered for sale devices which, or the use of which, infringes at least the '963' patent,\" the Foundation said in a complaint filed at the United States Western District Court of Washington State at Seattle.A spokesman for CSR, which was not sued by the research group as it does not sell the chips directly into the United States, said the firm was looking closely at the legal documents but declined to comment further.Nokia declined to comment. \"We are currently studying the claims,\" said spokeswoman Eija-Riitta Huovinen.Samsung and Panasonic were not immediately available to comment.One analyst said that patent cases such as these were notoriously unpredictable in their outcome, while another said the worst case scenario would merely see CSR pay the university for the licenses.\"I think it's far too early to say but apparently innocuous patent cases can blow up into a bit of a mine,\" said Nomura analyst Sean Murphy.\"It could take years before it will be obvious whether it represents a serious threat,\" he added.Named after a 10th century Scandinavian King, Bluetooth technology uses radio frequency to enable mobile phones and other electronic gadgets to talk to each other and transfer data over short distances without the need for wires.Engineer Jaap Haartsen at Swedish mobile phone maker Ericsson (ERICb.ST) has been credited with the invention of Bluetooth during his research work in the second half of the 1990s.Ericsson has donated the technology, royalty-free, to create a large market for the wire replacement.Hundreds of millions of mobile phones, headsets and laptops are now equipped with Bluetooth chips every year, while a number of adaptations have been made to the technology to make it faster.(Additional reporting by Tarmo Virki in Helsinki, Lucas van Grinsven in Amsterdam)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-csr-bluetooth-patent-idUSL0313406120070103", "sectors": [["Asian Markets"]], "title": "csr shares hit by bluetooth infringement claims"},

So they have made a face-saving retreat.\"Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid, secretary-general of Jamaat-e-Islami, a BNP ally, urged the interim authority to deal with attempts to \"foil the election and create lawlessness with heavy hands\".BIAS CLAIMHasina denounced the Election Commission saying \"biased and dishonest\" officials could not be trusted to hold a free and impartial election.\"They must be removed while corrupt and partisan civil officials be kept off duty during the polls,\" she said.Bangladesh's constitution stipulates that the interim authority must hold new elections within three months, although this can be extended with permission from the Supreme Court.Hasina said people would take responsibility to protect the constitution and preserve democracy, \"but they want to get rid of a corrupt and biased administration first,\" hinting that she could re-enter the election race should her demands be met.Bangladesh's giant neighbor India said the election machinery in Bangladesh should inspire confidence.\"It is our hope that the people of Bangladesh will be able to elect a government of their own choice in a free, fair credible and democratic election,\" an Indian foreign ministry spokesman said in response to questions about Hasina's decision.At least 45 people have been killed and hundreds injured in political violence since the interim government took over to steer the country to the polls.Hasina on Wednesday reaffirmed plans to stage a countrywide protest on January 5, followed by transport blockades on January 7 and 8.(Additional reporting by Serajul Islam Quadir, Azad Majumder, Ruma Paul and Y.P.

By contrast, the next move on U.S. interest rates is likely to be a cut from 5.25 percent after a steady policy in recent months.Japanese rates are seen rising at a very gradual pace from 0.25 percent, maintaining the euro's yield advantage.Official figures for December showed the number of unemployed people in Germany posted its sharpest monthly fall since 1950, pushing the jobless rate below 10 percent for the first time in over four years.The euro hit its highest level against the Swiss franc in almost seven years, but fell 0.4 percent against the dollar to $1.3223 EUR=, more than half a cent below three-week highs set in the previous session.FOMC MINUTES, U.S. DATA DUEMinutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest rate-setting meeting at 1900 GMT were seen casting light on current thinking for the U.S. rate outlook, with analysts widely expecting that the next move in borrowing costs will be a cut.Fed officials have been talking tough on inflation even as the market bet on rate cuts, and dollar bears will be looking for any hint of a softer tone.The Institute for Supply Management's December reading on the U.S. manufacturing sector is also due, while Friday brings the non-farm payrolls report for December.A reading below 50 in the ISM index, which dipped below the boom-or-bust level for the first time in three-and-a-half years in November, would reinforce concerns about an economic slowdown.The ISM is forecast to give a reading of 49.9.Other U.S. data due on Wednesday includes the ADP December employment report at 1315 GMT, often seen as a precursor to Friday's payrolls data.(Additional reporting by Simon Falush in London)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-markets-forex-idUSN2941694320070103", "sectors": [["Asian Markets"]], "title": "yen hits record low vs euro"},
{"date": "06:57 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "MUMBAI The proliferation of budget airlines across Asia has made air travel affordable for millions, but this week's aircraft disaster in Indonesia has underlined the challenge for governments to ensure safety standards are met.Analysts say there is no hard evidence that budget airlines are more accident-prone than full-service carriers, but admit they have a harder job convincing the public they are not cutting corners as well as costs.The biggest challenge, they say, is for government and regulatory agencies to ensure that infrastructure and safety norms are sufficient to meet a surge in demand for air travel.\"The rapid growth in aviation is creating problems because infrastructure is inadequate and regulation has not kept pace ... it's got nothing to do with the business models of airlines,\" said Gautam Roy, an analyst at Edelweiss Securities.\"The onus is on the government and regulators to deal with the situation.\"Low-cost carriers had 17 percent of the total number of scheduled seats on offer worldwide in 2006, up nearly 16 percent from the previous year, according to travel data firm   OAG.Low-cost carriers had 24 percent of seat capacity in Europe and 9 percent in Asia Pacific in 2006. In Asia, seat offer and frequency rose 55 percent on the year, OAG said.Governments have struggled to cope with the rapid changes.Thailand only recently opened a new airport to replace its aging single-runway airport, while in India, steps to modernize overburdened airports have been painfully slow and hampered by protesting airport workers and communist allies.But while pioneer Deccan Aviation's inaugural flight was grounded, discount carriers in India have a good safety record.\"Because we cut costs it does not mean we cut corners,\" said Ajay Singh, a director at budget carrier SpiceJet Ltd..\"In fact, since budget carriers are newer, our fleets and crews are newer than full-service carriers.\"Certainly, more technical snags have delayed aircraft operated by state-owned Indian, which has struggled with an aging fleet for more than a dozen years.New airlines including Kingfisher Airlines and budget carrier GoAir have also been quicker to adopt technology like CAT-III systems to enable them to fly in fog.PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORThe missing Adam Air plane is the latest in a series of incidents involving budget carriers in Indonesia. Elsewhere in the region, Malaysia's AirAsia, the region's largest budget carrier with a fleet of 50 planes, and Seoul's Hansung Airlines have had burst tyres and bad landings. No one was injured in any of these incidents.Still, these instances, along with cases of misleading advertising and poor customer service, have generally given rise to the perception that discount carriers are less safe.\"There's definitely a psychological factor that goes against low-cost carriers,\" said an analyst who declined to be named.\"We tend to feel: they're cheaper, so they must be cutting corners. So while there is nothing prima facie to suggest they are less safe than full-service carriers, they do have to work harder to disprove the general perception.\"Travelers have also been quicker to damn newer Asian budget carriers than their European and American counterparts including Ryanair, easyJet and Southwest Airlines.\"In many cases criticism has come from first-time travelers who expect too much and are quick to criticize,\" said Kapil Kaul, chief executive of the Center for Asia-Pacific Aviation in India.Still, there are concerns about the sharp contrast in the fatal crash rates between large, first-world airlines and small ones in developing countries.In Africa and the Middle East, the rate of fatal accidents -- which is falling globally -- was higher in 2000-2004 than 1995-1999.The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is pushing airlines to sign up to the IATA Operational Safety Audit for best practice in maintenance and operations by December 2008.Budget carriers may have to go the extra mile.\"They're going to have to share more information with the public to offset any negative perception -- and it's only a perception -- of safety standards,\" Kaul said.(Additional reporting by Jalil Hamid in Malaysia, Cheon Jong-Woo in Seoul, Teruaki Ueno in Tokyo, Jason Neely in London)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-airlines-safety-idUSBOM7098820070103", "sectors": [], "title": "budget airlines have tough job convincing skeptics"},

{"date": "06:38 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "  (Updates prices, adds fresh quotes, changes byline) By Carolyn CohnLONDON Jan 3 (Reuters) - The yen hit a record low against\nthe euro and a two-month low against the dollar on Wednesday as\nthe hunt for yield dominated sentiment ahead of U.S. data that\ncould give clues on the direction of U.S. interest rates. Carry plays, using low-yielding currencies such as the yen\nto fund purchases of units with more attractive interest rates,\nwere the major factor behind the euro's pulse higher, analysts\nsaid. The euro has hit successive record highs against the yen in\nrecent weeks, as investors look for a quicker pace of monetary\ntightening in the euro zone than in Japan. \"What we're seeing on euro/yen is pretty much a continuation\nof the themes from the end of last year -- the theme of carry is\nstill very much in place,\" BNP Paribas senior currency\nstrategist Ian Stannard said. A holiday in Tokyo kept liquidity thin, analysts added. By 1053 GMT, the euro had hit a record peak of 158.02\nEURJPY= according to Reuters data, its fourth record high in a\nweek, with technical analysts looking for the pair to break\n160/161 yen in coming weeks. \"The euro zone has stronger inflation so there is not as\ncompelling a case for the BOJ (Bank of Japan) to hike rates as\nthere is for the ECB (European Central Bank),\" said Daragh\nMaher, currency strategist at Calyon. The dollar rose half a percent to 119.45 yen JPY=, and\nsterling and the Australian dollar also hit multi-year highs\nagainst the Japanese currency. The high-yielding Australian dollar hit a one-year high\nagainst the U.S. dollar AUD=, but the lower-yielding Canadian\ndollar hit a nine-month low against the greenback CAD=.\n RATE MOVES The ECB is expected to raise borrowing costs to 3.75 percent\nin coming months from the current 3.5. By contrast, the next\nmove on U.S. interest rates is likely to be a cut from 5.25\npercent after a steady policy in recent months. Japanese rates are seen rising at a very gradual pace from\n0.25 percent, maintaining the euro's yield advantage. Official figures for December showed the number of\nunemployed people in Germany posted its sharpest monthly fall\nsince 1950, pushing the jobless rate below 10 percent for the\nfirst time in over four years. The euro hit its highest level against the Swiss franc in\nalmost seven years, but fell 0.4 percent against the dollar to\n$1.3223 EUR=, more than half a cent below three-week highs set\nin the previous session.\n FOMC MINUTES, U.S. DATA DUE Minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest rate-setting\nmeeting at 1900 GMT were seen casting light on current thinking\nfor the U.S. rate outlook, with analysts widely expecting that\nthe next move in borrowing costs will be a cut. Fed officials have been talking tough on inflation even as\nthe market bet on rate cuts, and dollar bears will be looking\nfor any hint of a softer tone. The Institute for Supply Management's December reading on\nthe U.S. manufacturing sector is also due, while Friday brings\nthe non-farm payrolls report for December. A reading below 50 in the ISM index, which dipped below the\nboom-or-bust level for the first time in three-and-a-half years\nin November, would reinforce concerns about an economic\nslowdown. The ISM is forecast to give a reading of 49.9. Other U.S. data due on Wednesday includes the ADP December\nemployment report at 1315 GMT, often seen as a precursor to\nFriday's payrolls data.\n  (Additional reporting by Simon Falush in London)\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/markets-forex-idUSL0312848920070103", "sectors": [], "title": "forex - yen hits record low vs euro , 2 - mth low vs dollar"},

But I didn't know what else to do with so many dead bodies,\" Leopold Kafares, 35, from Flores island, told Reuters.He was speaking at a hospital in Surabaya, East Java where he was being treated after being picked up at sea.At least 205 passengers have been rescued after the sinking of the Senopati Nusantara ferry overnight last Friday, but bad weather and high seas have meant many have only been found after days afloat in life rafts or in the water.Kafares said when the ferry ran into trouble in rough seas passengers scrambled for life buoys or space in life rafts.Just as the ship was capsizing, \"I found a life raft in front of me. I struggled to get into the craft with four other people,\" he said.But the others died in the rough weather conditions and with food and fresh water lacking, as did more people he helped pull into the raft later, he said.Hundreds are still missing from the Senopati Nusantara, which according to its manifest was carrying 628 people, including 57 crew. Scores of bodies have been sighted afloat or washed up on beaches.PANICAs of Tuesday some survivors were still on life rafts in the open water, with food being airdropped to them as rough seas and bad weather prevented rescue craft from reaching them.Search and rescue efforts involving military, government agency and civilian vessels, planes and helicopters have focused on saving lives first over recovering the dead.Another survivor at the Surabaya hospital, Refi Setiawan, a 29-year-old from Central Java, said ferry passengers were screaming hysterically as the ship started to list.\"Panic peaked when water got to the deck. The ship slanted to the left but in a few seconds it slanted to the right and immediately capsized,\" he told Reuters.\"I, thank God, was able to hold onto a wooden panel until a fisherman helped me. I thought I was dead\" after sweltering tropical heat, downpours and being tossed about in the rough seas, said Setiawan.High waves and strong sea currents were pushing the bodies of the dead and the living eastward in the direction of Surabaya, the capital of East Java province and Indonesia's second largest city, Central Java province rescue coordinator Eko Prayitno told Reuters on Tuesday.Rescue efforts are expected to continue through at least the weekend.Transportation Minister Hatta Rajasa has said the Japanese-built, 2,178-ton ferry was seaworthy and had a capacity of more than 850 passengers.Ships and ferries are a popular means of transport among Indonesia's 17,000 islands. However, safety standards are not always enforced, and accidents occur fairly often.Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country, is also coping with an apparent airline disaster.

Although GM still sells twice as many cars in the U.S.\nmarket as Toyota Motor Corp. (7203.T), it is on track to be\novertaken by Toyota for the global top spot in terms of\nproduction in 2007. And even after the share rally of last year, GM also has a\nmarket capitalization, at $17 billion, that is just one-twelfth\nthat of Toyota's and one-fourth that of Honda Motor Co.\n(7267.T) The disappearance of billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian,\nwho had agitated for changes at GM before selling off his\nstake, removes the uncertainty of a fight for board control but\nalso puts the spotlight back on GM management in 2007, analysts\nsaid. \"Wagoner's hotseat has cooled down a little bit,\" Argus\nResearch analyst Kevin Tynan said. \"But at the same time, the\npressure has risen a bit because now there is no outside\nactivist, it's all about Wagoner and his strategy. So in a way\nKerkorian's departure intensifies long-term pressure.\" 'BIG BUT OUTDATED' GM executives say they understand the magnitude of the\nproblems. An internal planning memo, which became public in\nDecember, describes the automaker as \"big but outdated\" and\nwarns that GM's \"advantages of size and economies of scale are\neroding.\" The strategy document, first reported by the Detroit News\nand confirmed by GM, also says that \"lack of flexibility is\nGM's chief disadvantage.\" That issue will loom large this year when GM kicks off\nlabor talks with the United Auto Workers union aimed it\nclinching a new four-year contract. For GM, which has not faced a strike since 1998, the\nnegotiations are expected to test a collaborative relationship\nwith the UAW as the automaker seeks to unwind many of the\ncostly obligations written into past contracts. Those include health-care costs averaging $1,500 per\nvehicle for GM and a \"jobs bank\" program that has morphed since\nits creation in 1984 into a nearly open-ended commitment to pay\nlaid-off union workers. \"What they have to get is major concessions to reduce cost,\ncreate flexibility, cut wages, retiree benefits and health-care\ncosts,\" said Standard & Poor's equity analyst Efraim Levy.\n\"They will also have to do away with the jobs bank.\" The UAW contract does not expire until Sept. 14 and\nintensive talks are not expected until the summer, but in the\nmeantime the automaker will have to clinch a deal with bankrupt\nformer subsidiary Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK and the UAW. That deal, which is central to Delphi's plans to emerge\nfrom bankruptcy, will determine the final tally for GM's\nDelphi-related liability, estimated at between $6 billion and\n$7.5 billion. CHANGING PLACES GM will likely be surpassed in global production by Toyota\nin 2007, ending a run of over 80 years as the No. 1 automaker.\nBut some analysts say that those bragging rights should be the\nleast of GM's concerns. \"It's a great headline grabber, but it is insignificant,\"\nErich Merkle of IRN Inc. said. \"All it means is that Toyota is\na dominant competitor, but we've known that for years. What GM\nhas to do, whether they are largest or second largest, is to\nfigure out how to make money selling cars.\" GM has several new car models hitting showrooms in 2007,\nincluding the Chevrolet Malibu, the Cadillac CTS and the Saturn\nAstra. It also has well-reviewed crossovers -- car-based\nutility vehicles that are smaller than its traditional SUVs --\nsuch as the GMC Acadia, Saturn Outlook and Buick Enclave. The\nnew Saturn Vue and Aura will also hit showrooms. \"GM has accomplished a lot of the groundwork needed for a\nturnaround in 2006,\" Tynan said. \"But they still have a lot of work to do. Their products\nneed to sell, they need to reach out to markets they have\nlagged in, such as the younger buyers and the West Coast, and\nthey need to start making a profit in North America,\" he said.\n (For other stories in the series, go to\nhere)\n\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/autoshow-gm-idUSN2644440920070103", "sectors": [], "title": "auto show : gm faces new pressures after year of deep cuts"},

{"date": "15:51 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "NEW YORK Investors will get a final tally on \nholiday sales this week as retailers release December sales \nfigures amid concerns heavy promotions used to lure customers \nwill cut into profits. Most U.S. retailers report December sales on Thursday, \nwhile electronics retailers Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY.N) and \nCircuit City Stores Inc. CC.N weigh in with their sales on \nFriday. Industry leader Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT.N) has already \nsaid its sales rose 1.6 percent in December at U.S. stores open \nat least a year, according to preliminary data, beating its own \nforecast of flat to up 1 percent. \"We believe Wal-Mart managed to deliver its above plan 1.6 \npercent comp (comparable-store sales) because of an extra \nselling day, an easy after Christmas week comparison, and \naggressive promotions as the season winded down,\" wrote Goldman \nSachs analyst Adrianne Shapira in a note. But she said the \"above plan\" sales for the retailer, which \naggressively promoted lower prices on electronics and toys, \nwere likely driven by \"above plan\" markdowns, which does not \nbode well for fourth-quarter earnings. The impact of markdowns will also be closely monitored in \nthe sales reports this week. \"Everyone is going to be looking to see if there's any \nmention within that news release of any change in earnings \nguidance, or anything in the language of the description of \nwhat occurred that can point toward and suggest earnings \ndirection for Q4,\" said Bernard Sands retail analyst Richard \nHastings. \"Q4 earnings is a big question mark and it looks like it's \nnot going to be a very good quarter for a lot of retailers.\"\n BATTLING ELECTRONICS Retail Metrics LLC, with an index of 57 retailers, expects \nDecember same-store sales to rise 3.3 percent, compared with a \n3.4 percent increase a year ago. Excluding Wal-Mart, the index forecasts a 4.6 percent gain \nin December same-store sales, and a 3.5 percent gain excluding \nWal-Mart and drug store chains. The index does not include Best \nBuy or Circuit City. Electronics were brisk sellers this holiday season as \nprices for flat-panel televisions plunged and retailers heavily \npromoted TVs, digital cameras, laptop computers and MP3 players \nto draw shoppers into their stores. Consumer technology retail sales from the week of Black \nFriday -- the day after Thanksgiving -- through the week ended \nDecember 23 were $8.75 billion -- up 6.5 percent from a year \nago, according to NPD Group. But this year's gain trailed last \nyear's 10 percent revenue rise due in part to the falling \nprices for flat-panel TVs, the market research firm said. While promotions -- which featured 42-inch plasma TVs \nselling for under $1,000 during the Thanksgiving shopping \nweekend -- drove sales, Best Buy and Circuit City have already \nsaid it hurt their profits for the third-quarter, which ended \nin November. The demand for the expensive advanced TVs could also mean \ndifficult results for apparel retailers if shoppers decided \nagainst buying that extra sweater or scarf after shelling out \nhundreds or thousands of dollars for a TV. Wall Street is also watching to see how retailers dealt \nwith procrastinators. Shoppers visited stores in droves during the November \nThanksgiving shopping weekend, but then paused and waited for \nretailers to roll out last-minute deals in December before they \nfinished their holiday shopping. \"We definitely know that the first half of the month was \nslow,\" said Dana Telsey, founder of research firm Telsey \nAdvisory Group. She said the question is: \"What was the pick-up in the \nsecond half of the month and how much did the last week add?\" Christmas fell on a Monday this year, giving shoppers a \nfinal weekend to shop ahead of the holiday. Retailers also faced unfavorable weather conditions in \nDecember. Shapira said the Goldman Sachs Rain or Shine \nIndicator showed the weather was 21 percent warmer this \nDecember compared with a year ago. \"Getting into the holiday spirit was tough when there was \nno hint of winter in the air.

The recent rise, which saw prices hit seven-week highs on\nTuesday, pointed to further gains by the futures market for\nrobustas, which are used mainly to produce soluble coffees. \"There is anticipation that the market has potential to move\nhigher -- stocks have come down,\" a London futures trader said. He said the market would set its sights on $1,700 and $1,750\na tonne if the $1,653 level was broken. Prices rose to a 7-1/2-year high of $1,653, basis the second\nposition on the futures market, on November 9 as investment\nfunds bought heavily amid reports of crop problems in Brazil,\nthe world's leading producer of all coffees, and growing world\nconsumption. Robusta futures surged 34 percent in 2006, fuelled by strong\nglobal demand for coffee, tightening supplies and growing\ninterest in the commodity from investment funds. Traders saw no reason for the bullish trend to lose momentum\nyet, but said selling by Vietnam, the world's biggest robusta\nexporter, at the peak of its harvest in the coming weeks would\nlimit gains. \"Robust export demand helped to underpin the market\nshort-term,\" analyst Redtower Research said in a report. On Tuesday benchmark March LKDH7 robustas touched $1,634,\ndriven up by fund and speculative buying. March eased on\nprofit-taking to stand at $1,607 early on Wednesday morning. \"If we don't get to $1,653 (in March futures) in the short\nterm, then I don't think we'll get to it until the second half\nof 2007,\" said Andrea Thompson, analyst with CoffeeNetwork. The London futures trader said $1,653 might be reached later\non Wednesday depending on the New York arabica futures market,\nwhich re-opens after a four-day break. London traders predicted a stronger opening by arabica\nfutures on the New York Board of Trade. Thompson estimated that total world coffee stocks at the\nbeginning of the 2006/07 season were 42 million bags, down from\n48 million at the beginning of 2005/06. Coffee output in Vietnam and Brazil was expected to decline\nin 2007/08 from 2006/07 for cyclical reasons, traders and\nanalysts said. In its first 2007/08 (July-June) coffee crop forecast on\nDecember 15, Brazil's government saw output at 31.1-32.3 million\n60-kg bags, sharply below the 42.5 million harvested this\nseason.\n Traders reported talk that investment funds might increase\ntheir allocations to coffee in 2007 in the hope of reaping\nfurther big returns after the strong gains seen in 2006. They noted buoyant export demand for coffee, noting strong\ngrowth potential in eastern Europe and Asia, especially for\nrobustas, as incomes grew.

All I want is to find out how my son is but I don't know how I can do it,\" Malawi's Daily Times newspaper quoted Yohane Banda as saying.\"I only talked to her once at the High Court and I want to talk to her now and find out about my child.\"The father of one-year-old David Banda made the comments after the newspaper presented him with a 400 pound ($788) check from Scottish nun, Christine Webster, who told the paper she believes Banda would have been better off staying in Malawi.Madonna's adoption of the child grabbed world headlines and caused some rights groups in Malawi to question whether she had used her celebrity to bypass laws governing the adoption of Malawians by foreigners.Madonna signed interim adoption papers when she and her husband, film maker Guy Ritchie, visited in October on what they said was a humanitarian mission to help Malawi orphans.Under the interim order, the child was to stay with Madonna for 18 months during which time his progress would be monitored by Malawian officials before deciding whether final approval may be given for him to remain with her family.The High Court order angered human rights groups who described it as illegal and took the issue to court.The high court has since granted the advocacy groups an application to be part of the adoption proceedings of Madonna, a move which offered some relief for her as it did not amount to a green light for the rights groups to mount a full challenge against the adoption.The controversy over Madonna's adoption of the boy has helped to spotlight the plight of orphans in Malawi.Over 900,000 children in Malawi are orphaned and another 500,000 have lost at least one parent.Banda dismissed any suggestions that he wants the child back and asked human rights groups not to interfere in his attempts to speak with Madonna.\"All I want is to find out how my child is doing and not to have him back,\" he was quoted as saying.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-malawi-madonna-father-idUSL021560920070103", "sectors": [["Entertainment, ", "People"]], "title": "father of boy adopted by madonna wants news of him"},

The gain came despite an 8 percent appreciation of the\nshekel ILS= against the dollar during the year that hurt\ncompanies with sales focused on the United States.

Awesome. 'I just got my college degree.' Awesome.\"The list gave short shrift to media shorthand for celebrity duos such as \"TomKat,\" for the union of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, and \"Brangelina,\" for Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.How would \"Lardy\" have sounded as a nickname for long-ago comedians Laurel and Hardy, or \"BogCall\" for Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, the list's compilers asked.Media bashers also welcomed banishment of the phrases \"gone missing\" or \"went missing.\"\"It makes 'missing' sound like a place you can visit, such as the Poconos,\" wrote contributor Robin Dennis of Flower Mound, Texas.The same goes for a robbery \"gone bad,\" which raises the question of whether a theft could go well and good, the list-makers said. Similarly, reporters covering the immigration issue should try again after coming up with \"undocumented alien,\" which was compared to euphemistically calling a drug dealer an \"undocumented pharmacist.\"The list also decried the use in everyday speech of the Internet typographical error \"pwn,\" as used when a game-player tells his defeated opponent \"I pwn you,\" instead of own you.\"Truthiness,\" popularized by comedian Stephen Colbert as truth unencumbered by the facts may have been named one of the top U.S. television buzzwords of the year in August by Global Language Monitor.

The market will also consider a reading on the health of\nmanufacturing when the Institute for Supply Management releases\nits December index. Economists expect the index to show a\ncontraction for the second straight month.

{"date": "07:57 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "  (Updates prices, adds fresh quotes) By Carolyn CohnLONDON Jan 3 (Reuters) - The yen hit a record low against\nthe euro on Wednesday as investors flocked to higher-yielding\ncurrencies, while the dollar strengthened across the board ahead\nof minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting. The yen also hit two-month lows against the dollar and\nmulti-year lows against sterling and the Australian dollar due\nto the impact of carry trades, using low-yielding currencies\nlike the yen to fund purchases of higher-yielding assets. The euro has hit successive record highs against the yen in\nrecent weeks, as investors look for a quicker pace of monetary\ntightening in the euro zone than in Japan. \"It's largely a carry trade story,\" said Antje Praefcke,\ncurrency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. \"People are also expecting slightly hawkish comments from\nthe Fed.\" A holiday in Tokyo kept liquidity thin, analysts added. By 1241 GMT, the euro had hit a record peak of 158.04\nEURJPY= according to Reuters data, its fourth record high in a\nweek, with technical analysts looking for the pair to break\n160/161 yen in coming weeks. The euro also hit its highest level against the Swiss franc\nin almost seven years. \"The euro zone has stronger inflation so there is not as\ncompelling a case for the BOJ (Bank of Japan) to hike rates as\nthere is for the ECB (European Central Bank),\" said Daragh\nMaher, currency strategist at Calyon. The ECB is expected to raise borrowing costs to 3.75 percent\nin coming months from the current 3.5. Japanese rates are seen rising at a very gradual pace from\n0.25 percent, maintaining the euro's yield advantage. The dollar rose half a percent to its highest level since\nlate October at 119.45 yen JPY=, and also hit nine-month highs\nagainst the lower-yielding Canadian dollar CAD=. The dollar also rose against the euro, with the single\ncurrency falling a third of a percent on the day to $1.3233\nEUR=, more than half a cent below three-week highs set in the\nprevious session. But the high-yielding Australian dollar hit a one-year high\nagainst the U.S. dollar AUD=.\n U.S. DATA Minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest rate-setting\nmeeting at 1900 GMT were seen casting light on current thinking\nfor the U.S. rate outlook, with analysts widely expecting that\nthe next move in borrowing costs will be a cut. Fed officials have been talking tough on inflation even as\nthe market bet on rate cuts, and dollar bears will be looking\nfor any hint of a softer tone, after the Fed left rates\nunchanged at 5.25 percent last month. The Institute for Supply Management's December reading on\nthe U.S. manufacturing sector is also due, while Friday brings\nthe non-farm payrolls report for December. A reading below 50 in the ISM index, which dipped below the\nboom-or-bust level for the first time in three-and-a-half years\nin November, would reinforce concerns about an economic\nslowdown. The ISM is forecast to give a reading of 49.9. Other U.S. data due on Wednesday includes the ADP December\nemployment report at 1315 GMT, often seen as a precursor to\nFriday's payrolls data.

{"date": "08:28 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "ISTANBUL As the magnitude of an earthquake in a television advert gradually mounts, the stone letters ISTANBUL crack, and then crumble to dust.If it seems alarmist, builder Cuneyt Kilic, whose company AKS Anatolian Housing is behind the graphic depicting the collapse of Turkey's largest city, says it is merely realistic.Many scientists agree the question is not if, but when in the next three decades a major earthquake will hit Istanbul, the former seat of the Byzantine and Ottoman empires and source of more than half Turkey's industrial output.Turkey's top seismologist said in November \"the big one\" could kill more than 100,000 people.Turkey lies on a major fault line and has had 90 earthquakes higher than magnitude 5 since 1903, including one in August 1999 when nearly 18,000 people were killed.Of those deaths 1,000 were in Istanbul, and many were blamed on sub-standard buildings thrown up by a construction industry rife with corruption.\"At the moment of the earthquake, coming from under ground, there's a sound, it's like a washing machine on a spin cycle,\" recalled grocer Gungor Dincer, who survived that quake.An earthquake in Istanbul in 1509, accompanied by floods and weeks of aftershocks, was so devastating it was described as the \"small doomsday\", opening fissures in the ground, bringing down the city walls and knocking over every minaret in the city, according to various accounts.The city of 13 million has been hit by quakes since then, but the epicenter has not been in Istanbul since 1894, or according to some experts 1766, when the quake was accompanied by a tsunami.\"NOT SCAREMONGERING\"\"We're not scaremongering,\" Kilic, deputy head of AKS told Reuters, saying people should be aware of the predictions. Some clearly are, as AKS has already sold 60 percent of a new development of quake-resistant steel-built houses due for handover this year.Concern has been mounting. A series of small earthquakes filled newspapers in recent weeks with expert predictions on when the next big one would come.In October local media quoted National Earthquake Council Chairman Haluk Eyidogan criticizing authorities for failing to enforce rules on construction and structural inspections.Istanbul's governor acknowledged that many of the city's buildings would not withstand a large quake; professors at one leading university recently resolved to stop talking to the press to avoid stirring panic.But if the fear of a quake is proving good business for some, Istanbul's ability to protect the less wealthy is a political concern.An earthquake plan was launched after the 1999 quake near Istanbul, but experts say no action has been taken on the studies commissioned.One such study completed in 2004 shows that of 16,000 buildings in one vulnerable area 2,300 were declared very high risk -- or expected to collapse in a quake. Two similar studies are due to be completed in other areas next year.\"Nothing has been done yet,\" said Haluk Sucuoglu, professor of civil engineering and member of the National Earthquake Council.\"There's no political motivation related to this. They claim they are motivated but we don't see any action,\" he added.\"$10 BILLION, 10 YEARS\"Amid such criticism, Istanbul recently launched a major disaster simulation exercise to reassure the public.Istanbul municipality's director of soil and earthquake research, Mahmut Bas, told Reuters hospitals, schools and fire stations had been reinforced, houses built legally since 1999 met stricter rules, and the rescue operation had improved.Turkey in October 2005 signed a $400 million plan with the World Bank to improve its preparation for an emergency, strengthen facilities for earthquake resistance and ensure better enforcement of building codes.That sum compares with a terse estimate from Istanbul's Bas for preparing the city for a quake: \"$10 billion, 10 years.\"To invest that would be tricky in a heavily indebted European Union-applicant country where the International Monetary Fund keeps a close eye on spending.And in a city which receives tens of thousands of rural migrants a year, and where luxury malls coexist with shanty towns, upscale buildings like those Kilic sells can only be aimed at the minority.In Turkey, where the underground economy is huge, almost a third of the construction industry in unregistered, according to an estimate from the head of Turkey's Cement Producers' Association Adnan Ignebekcili.That leaves the rest in the city to weigh their options: refit buildings, pull them down, or trust to fate.Halim Sahin, an Istanbul real estate agent, said only 20 to 30 percent of his clients even ask about how safe a building would be in an earthquake.\"There's fatalism. People think you could die in a car crash, or of a heart attack ... As a society we're fatalists.\"(Additional reporting by Thomas Grove)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-turkey-earthquake-idUSL129987920070103", "sectors": [["World"]], "title": "quake - prone istanbul awaits disaster"},

Gold also inched lower, as investors took\nprofits and the U.S. dollar rose marginally against the euro. A higher U.S. dollar means gold is more expensive to buy\nfor holders of other currencies and can curb demand for the\nprecious metal. Weakness in oil and gold could mean that the share prices\nof the companies that drill and mine the commodities could see\ndeclines.

Davis, however, suggested the TSX will still push ahead\nduring at least the first three months of the year. \"I think it probably will go up in the first quarter, but\nthen we'll be looking to consolidate somewhat,\" he said, adding\na pullback later in the year is possible.

{"date": "08:42 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " TORONTO, Jan 3 The Canadian dollar fell hard\nversus the U.S. dollar on Wednesday as commodity prices turned\nlower while a slew of market players adjusted positions\naccording to recent economic data after the holiday break. Domestic bonds prices were higher ahead of U.S. data  that\ncould offer clues on the direction of U.S. interest rates. At 8:35 a.m. (1335 GMT), the Canadian unit was at C$1.1695\nto the U.S. dollar, or 85.51 U.S. cents, down from C$1.1636 to\nthe U.S. dollar, or 85.94 U.S. cents, at Tuesday's close. The Canadian dollar fell as low as C$1.1700 to the U.S.\ndollar earlier as investors focused on recent U.S. data that\nsuggested the U.S. Federal Reserve may hold rates steady for a\nlonger period than many expected. \"The data coming out of the States over the last couple of\nweeks has been quite good but the market's been in flow mode\nbecause of all the holidays,\" said Steven Butler, director of\nforeign exchange at Scotia Capital.\" \"Today's the first day that the market's been back to full\nstrength so we'll have to see if we start to get a better feel\nfor what's actually going on in the world.\" The Canadian dollar was also hurt by a drop in commodity\nprices as mild weather in the U.S. Northeast shook oil prices\nand a bout of profit-taking hit gold prices after they came\nclose to a one-month higher. The Canadian dollar often shadows the moves in oil and gold\nprices since Canada is a producer and net exporter of oil and\nmany base metals. January is expected to be a volatile month for currency\nmarkets as it marks the start of a new financial year for most\npeople and many investors are putting off positions. \"You don't want to bet the farm on a trend emerging in the\nfirst week or two,\" said Butler. \"I think by the end of January\nwe'll probably have a much better feel for how Q1 is going to\nshape up.\" BONDS RISE Canadian bond prices were higher, but with no domestic data\non tap dealers were waiting to see reports out of the United\nStates as well as minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's\nlatest rate-setting meeting. The economic calendar in Canada picks up on Thursday with\nNovember producer and raw materials prices, as well as jobs\nfigures for December and the December Ivey Purchasing Managers\nindex on Friday. The two-year bond climbed 4 Canadian cents to C$100.50 to\nyield 3.976 percent, while the 10-year bond rose 18 Canadian\ncents to C$99.72 to yield 4.036 percent. The yield spread between the two-year and 10-year bond\nmoved to 5.7 basis points from 6.4 at the previous close. The 30-year bond rose 35 Canadian cents to C$126.50 to\nyield 4.098 percent.

{"date": "08:45 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Alabama For years, Al Rohling watched parents quit their jobs when their kids got sick, deliberately making their incomes drop to a point where they could get U.S. government medical help.Rohling, who directed Alabama's housing authority at the time, reached a startling conclusion: If children could drive parents into hardship when they became ill, could medical insurance help parents rediscover financial health?\"Health care for children really is a bridge to get out of poverty,\" said Rohling.Rohling quit his job in 1988 to help set up the Child Caring Foundation, which provides free health insurance for children through the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama health care provider.The foundation is just one example a charity that bridges the gap between Medicaid -- subsidized insurance -- for the poorest and private health insurance paid for either privately for those who can afford it or by an employer.That gap leaves up to 9 million U.S. children uninsured in the United States, a nation with no universal health care, and many parents are forced to struggle with a patchwork of other provisions in order to get health care for their children.\"The problem of the uninsured is getting worse,\" and the number of uninsured children has risen since 2004, said Jennifer Tolbert, principal analyst with the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, a Washington-based think tank.Tolbert said it was possible the U.S. Congress could increase the scope of the State Children's Health Insurance Progam (SCHIP) to provide greater state coverage for uninsured children when it debates reauthorizing the program next year.IN THE LURCHChildren with health insurance are usually taken to the doctor at the first sign of illness, while parents of uninsured kids often wait because they are conscious of the cost.Then the child's illness can worsen and the parent is forced to miss work to nurse the child back to health.In Alabama, there were 230,000 uninsured children in 1988, and that has fallen to around 70,000 due to a combination of the Child Caring Foundation and state programs.Jody Sharp, 60, is an example of the problem the charity aims to address.She and her husband adopted a foster child, Dana, from a mother who was mentally handicapped. Later, they adopted Dana's brother Kyle who has epilepsy and asthma.But Sharp's husband, the family wage earner, walked out in 1990, leaving Sharp to bring up the two children with no health insurance.\"If you never had a child with epilepsy, you would never know how many bills you can incur. With no insurance, it's thousands of dollars just like that,\" Sharp told Reuters.During their two years in the Alabama Blue Cross Blue Shield program, Sharp's children received free medical care and she found a job working with special needs children. The money saved helped her move into private health insurance.Some 90 percent of the 55,000 children on the program move into private health insurance within about 30 months.\"All of us have times when we lose jobs or lose our homes. You need the support of insurance so you don't have to worry about squeezing doctor bills out of an already stretched paycheck,\" said Sharp.BEAR'S EYETo recruit families, Rohling tours the state presenting health screenings at schools with the help of volunteers from the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Nursing and elsewhere.At one recent presentation, a student nurse pulled a teddy bear eye out of a child's ear, ending three years of one-sided deafness. It was an example of how problems can fester for children who don't have health insurance.Low cost health insurance for low income American children began in Pittsburgh in 1985 when Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Western Pennsylvania insured children of laid-off steel workers. By 2006, 144,000 children were in their program.\"There was a crisis. And the whole thing came about as an answer for how health insurance should work,\" said spokesperson Denise Grabner of Highmark.In 1997, the program expanded to include children of the working poor when Congress enacted the SCHIP providing some matching funding.Alabama was the first of 20 states to participate, creating the All Kids program, with money from state settlement with tobacco companies. The program provides insurance for children above the level at which they would qualify for Medicaid.Many states now provide insurance for families who earn up to double the poverty rate, defined as $10,000 a year for a single person and $20,000 for a family of four. But Rohling said an individual needed to earn nearly three times the poverty level to afford private insurance.\"We fill the void between affordability and eligibility.\"", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-usa-poverty-children-idUSN1940733220070103", "sectors": [["U.S., ", "Health"]], "title": "health insurance bridges gap for poor families"},
{"date": "08:45 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "BEERSHEBA, Israel An Israeli firm has designed a security system to ensure jailbreakers or intruders find a guard dog's bark can indeed be worse than its bite.Harnessing technology that interprets barking -- to see if an animal is responding to a threat instead of just routinely woofing -- the company aims to replace or supplement expensive electronic surveillance systems.\"There is currently very little utilisation of the watchdog's early warning capabilities,\" says privately owned manufacturer Bio-Sense Technologies, based in the Israeli town of Petah Tikva, on its Web site.The company -- which says dogs have better night vision than humans and a vastly superior sense of smell and hearing -- used computers to analyze 350 barks and found dogs of all breeds and sizes barked the same alarm when they sensed a threat.If the dogs sense an intruder or attempted security breach, dozens of sensors around the facility pick up their \"alarm bark\" and alert the human operators in the control room.Dubbed \"Doguard\", the Dog Bio Security system is in place in high-security Eshel Prison as well as Israeli military bases, water installations, farms, ranches, garages and in Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank.Eshel Prison installed the system last year to supplement its existing network of electric fences and human guards, prison officer Bazov Moris told Reuters.Now Rex, a brown American Staffordshire Terrier, Emmy, a white Caanan, and 27 other dogs guarding the prison are tracked by sensors to alert guards to any attempted breakout at the jail, which houses about 3,000 prisoners including Israelis and Palestinians.There have been no escape attempts since the system was installed, but Moris is convinced it works. He said prisoners at other facilities had been able to escape \"because dogs barked but no alert was sent to the guards\".During a demonstration an alarm wailed as Rex and Emmy raced, growling and snarling, alongside one of the facility's metal fences, which a man in a brown uniform was trying to scale from the other side.Officers in a small basement office nearby watched on a surveillance video and spoke into their walkie-talkies as a wall of computer screens flashed in red: \"Dog alarm in Sector 12\".Seconds later, several prison guards, wielding clubs, raced to the scene and tackled the man to the ground.NOT FOOLPROOFThe dog bark-reader is just one of a batch of innovative security systems to emerge from Israel, which business magazine Forbes said in December had emerged as \"the go-to country for anti-terrorism technologies\".By monitoring not just the dogs' barks, but also their physiological responses -- like heart rates -- it joins a trend for computer systems building on animal knowledge that humans also share.Another Israeli example, from Suspect Detection Systems, offers border checkpoints a computer quiz that alerts guards if travellers show a marked physiological response to particularly tough questions.However, Doguard is not foolproof. When first set up at Eshel Prison and at a water installation and farm in central Israel, the dogs triggered several false alarms, officials said.\"The dogs need two to three weeks to adapt -- they must get to know their territory,\" said Daniel Low, chief executive officer of Meniv Rishon, the municipal water system of the Israeli town of Rishon Lezion.Low said he had installed the system in several places to replace guards.Galia Alon, an official at Modi'in Ezrahi, a large Israeli security company that supplies private guards and equipment, cautioned against relying on dogs as a first line of defense.\"Dogs are excellent at spotting intruders -- they are well trained and have a more sharpened sense of smell than humans,\" she said. \"But people can identify people by looking at them and talking to them, and they are more inclined to catch them.\"Yossi Brami, manager of a dairy at Kibbutz Gezer, a communal farm, had the system installed two months ago. He said he was told dogs work better in pairs because one signals to the other if an intruder appears, so two were placed to guard his calves.The dogs used in the alarm system were rescued from shelters, Bio-Sense chief executive officer Eyal Zehavi said, adding some clients asked for them to be trained professionally first.Eshel Prison's dogs live in individual kennels. Several times a day, they are let out to patrol buildings, where they are unleashed in a fenced-in compound.At Kibbutz Gezer, dogs Chief and Lola are kept on a long chain and are released to run around the farm several times a day. The dogs guarding Meniv Rishon are also chained.Israeli animal rights societies said they knew little about the system but it was preferable for dogs to live indoors and unleashed.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-israel-dogs-idUSL1977358220070103", "sectors": [["Science, ", "Tech, ", "Oddly Enough"]], "title": "from yap to growl , israeli device dogs intruders"},

Most Australians would certainly have seen 2006 as a dry year,\" Plummer said.Australia's average temperature for 2006 was 0.47 Celsius (1 Fahrenheit) above the long-term average, but it was only the eleventh warmest year since 1910, the bureau report said.And despite record daily temperatures in the southeast, last year was cooler than 2005 due to a very active tropical wet season early in the year.Plummer said an El Nino weather event in the Pacific Ocean bringing severe drought to eastern Australia was responsible for much of the variation, but that was beginning to weaken.\"What we see on the rainfall is a signature of El Nino. There are signs that is weakening and most times we see a breakdown in late summer or autumn, and usually a good break with lots of rain.\"", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-australia-climate-idUSSYD15475920070103", "sectors": [["Science"]], "title": "climate change faster in australia : scientists"},

Bond prices rose on what analysts said could be the start\nof a rethink of the view that the U.S. economy remained\nresilient. A string of recent firmer-than-expected data hit the\nbond market in December, which suffered its sharpest selloff in\nnine months. Bond investors were also turning their sights to a pivotal\nnational manufacturing report due at 10 a.m. (1500 GMT) and to\nminutes from the Federal Reserve's December policy-setting\nmeeting, due at 2 p.m. (1900 GMT). \"Clearly, going into the employment data this Friday,\npeople coming into the New Year with a clean book would\ncertainly feel that this (the ADP report) is something people\nwant to be buying bonds on\", said Michael Cheah, vice president\nand portfolio manager with AIG SunAmerica Asset Management in\nJersey City. U.S. private sector employment likely declined by 40,000 in\nDecember, the first contraction since April 2003, according to\nthe ADP National Employment Report.

Bond\nyields and prices move inversely. Flat positioning and prices at the low end of recent ranges\nhelped set the stage for bonds to rally on the weak data, Cheah\nadded. Two-year notes US2YT=RR -- which respond closely to\nexpectations for Federal Reserve interest rate moves -- rose\n3/32 in price for a yield of 4.75 percent, versus 4.78 percent\nbefore the ADP report and compared with 4.80 percent on\nTuesday.

{"date": "09:25 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "CHICAGO Doctors can follow a set of guidelines to identify sick children who might have a deadly form of meningitis, sparing young patients days in the hospital, researchers said on Tuesday.Meningitis produces swelling of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The bacterial form that occurs in one in 25 cases can produce a more severe illness than the viral form.Doctors often cannot determine which type of meningitis a patient has until a bacterial culture is produced in the laboratory -- requiring up to a three-day wait. Just in case, most patients are admitted to the hospital and treated with powerful antibiotics.But guidelines developed four years ago and recently tested in a trial of 3,300 patients aged 29 days to 19 years correctly classified all but two patients, both of whom were younger than 2 months and more difficult to diagnose, according to the study published in this week's issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.The criteria include routine tests of blood and fluids and a checklist, including whether the child has had seizures since falling ill.\"The ability to identify those children who are at very low risk of bacterial meningitis and can be considered for management on an outpatient basis will avoid unnecessary hospitalization and aggressive antibiotic therapy,\" said study author Dr. Nathan Kuppermann of the University of California-Davis Medical Center.A vaccine to combat bacterial meningitis has been recommended in the United States for at-risk children younger than 2 since 2000, reducing the incidence of the disease, the report said.\"The finding is important because it gives emergency room physicians nationwide a tool to guide their decision-making when caring for children with suspected meningitis, a serious and potentially life-threatening infection,\" said study co-author Lise Nigrovic of Children's Hospital Boston.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-meningitis-idUSN0234382520070103", "sectors": [["Health"]], "title": "guidelines help diagnose severe meningitis : study"},

The rest are missing,\" Laxmi Prasad Manandhar, a senior official at the Department of National Park and Wildlife Conservation, said.But he ruled out the possibility of all the 49 missing rhinos falling prey to poachers.\"If poachers had killed them they should have left behind the bodies\" after taking away the horn, he said, adding that just one rhino skeleton had been found during an extensive search in June.\"Where did they go? I have no answer. It is a mystery,\" Manandhar said.The rhinos were moved to Babai Valley from Chitwan National Park on Nepal's southern plains under a conservation scheme supported by global conservation group WWF.In December, Nepal's Supreme Court ordered the government to step up security at Chitwan -- the Himalayan nation's biggest rhino reserve -- after local media reported at least 10 animals had been killed since July.Officials say at least 12 rhinos had died in the past six months in Chitwan where their population dropped to 372 in 2005 from 544 in 2000.Their numbers fell mainly due to poaching for horns which are believed to have aphrodisiac qualities and are in great demand in China.In the Babai Valley, rhinos were last seen seven years ago when several security posts were closed due to threats from the Maoist rebels who targeted them during their decade-long insurgency against Nepal's monarchy.The Maoists declared a ceasefire in April and signed a peace deal with the government in November, allowing easier and safer movement of forestry officials.Nepal began its rhino conservation drive 30 years ago when the population fell to 108 animals from around 800 in 1950. One-horned rhinos are also found in the northeastern Indian state of Assam.The one-horned species of the rhinoceros has been one of the greatest conservation success stories in South Asia. With strict protection, especially in India, their total numbers have touched around 2,500 from 100 about a century ago.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-nepal-rhinoceros-idUSDEL15964520070103", "sectors": [["Science"]], "title": "rare nepal rhinos mysteriously disappear"},
{"date": "09:31 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "LONDON Traditional media companies are ideally placed to benefit from the explosion of user-generated content and should see it as an opportunity and not a threat even though the potential revenue is limited, a report says.The phenomenon of consumers contributing their own photographs, video and blogs took the media industry by storm in 2006 through Web sites such as YouTube and according to a report by consultancy Deloitte on media trends for 2007, that is unlikely to change.The trend prompted headlines that the traditional media was losing sway with the consumer but Howard Davies, a director of media strategy at Deloitte, said print and TV had been wise to stand back and see how the practice developed.\"(They) are very well positioned to adopt some of the technology and some of the emerging social practice ... but incorporating it alongside traditional media channels to create an overall richer product,\" he told Reuters.Davies said user-generated content could be split into two categories with one for people looking for \"five minutes of fame\" via the likes of YouTube and MySpace and the other for people looking to contribute to a discussion or community.\"The one group that has made the most hype is the so-called 'five minutes of fame' and I'm not necessarily convinced that that will continue to grow,\" Davies said.\"In fact you might find people start to get bored with it (but) the less glamorous use of the Internet as a form of creating user generated content is part of society now.\"News channels including the British Broadcasting Corp. and BSkyB have shown user-generated content including footage taken on mobile phones from events such as the 2005 London bombings.Web search leader Google last year agreed to acquire YouTube for $1.65 billion in stock.Davies also cited \"Runner's World\" magazine which has created forums for group discussions as a success story and said broadcasters could use the medium to gain feedback on programs or create a buzz before they were launched.However the report by Deloitte's Technology, Media and Telecommunications Industry group said the potential for generating revenue was likely to be limited.\"There's something about the social user ... community that is absolutely not professional and so the community doesn't want it to be commercialized,\" he said about advertising around Web sites dedicated to the content.\"It's so easy to set up a rival offering and there's very little loyalty to these sites and you can move to another one fairly easily and if you want to avoid adverts then you will.\"Looking ahead for 2007, Deloitte said another major topic for media companies would be the desire to \"crack\" China.Deloitte said China was a challenging market for foreign media companies due to government censorship and restrictions on foreign ownership and said the other major factor to deal with would be piracy.However head of media research Paul Lee said there was huge potential in China with the Olympic Games to be held in Beijing in 2008, a fast-growing middle class who would be looking to buy genuine goods and a strong desire to see Chinese brands become global.He said companies needed to be patient and form positive relationships with Chinese business partners and government agencies rather than trying to rush for market penetration.\"The Olympics will force the hand of the Chinese to be more open,\" he said in an interview.\"(But companies) need to understand the history and have the patience to grow with China. It's such a massive beast which cannot change overnight but will change over decades. It may be that the investment you're making now will be reaped by your successors.\"The full Deloitte report on media predictions will be released later in January.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-media-predictions-idUSL0292815620070103", "sectors": [["Tech"]], "title": "user - generated content good for old media - report"},

{"date": "09:41 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "NEW YORK Few people gave the New York Jets a fighting chance of contending for the NFL title this season, yet rookie head coach Eric Mangini has managed to instil a combative spirit that has lifted the Jets into the playoffs.Transforming the Jets from a four-win season to a 10-6 mark, the coach has been dubbed \"Mangenius\" by local tabloids as he parlayed a disciplined approach and his love of boxing into tutorials that have helped bring out the best in his team.Before most games this season, the 35-year-old Mangini has shown a fight film at a team meeting -- featuring the likes of Muhammad Ali, Vito Antuofermo and Aaron Pryor -- to deliver a message or underline a theme for the game.Mangini gets one more duel with mentor Bill Belichick when his Jets go on the road Sunday as big underdogs against AFC East champion New England Patriots (12-4) in the first round.Defying the odds is nothing new for New York, who have already split a pair of close games this season with New England, where Mangini served his NFL coaching apprenticeship under three-times Super Bowl winner Belichick.Prior to New York's November encounter with the Pats in Foxborough, Mangini screened the first Sonny Liston-Cassius Clay heavyweight title bout to urge them not to be intimidated by an opponent who had beaten them seven times in a row.Mangini also invited noted boxing trainer Teddy Atlas to address the players before the contest.Atlas, who ran the famed Catskills gym of Cus D'Amato and was the first trainer of a teenaged Mike Tyson, spoke about the intimidation factor.\"I told them one thing that I know about Tyson, that his greatest strength was other people's weaknesses,\" Atlas told Reuters in a telephone interview.\"He didn't really have a pro fight until 30-something fights. His first pro fight was against a guy named Buster Douglas in Japan,\" he said about Tyson's first defeat.\"That was the first time somebody didn't go in there just intimidated and just giving him a free ride.\"He (Douglas) behaved the way you're supposed to behave, like a professional fighter. Tyson had never had a pro fight, but that night he did. (Douglas) showed up and he fought him.\"When you're playing New England, why don't you just go play them? Go play them.\"The Jets beat the Patriots 17-14, showing the fighting spirit that helped them post a 6-2 road record this season.CHARACTER VALUEMangini has found his own style of preparing a team but acknowledges the debt he owes Belichick.\"Philosophically there are a lot of similarities, attack weaknesses, minimize strengths and play to your strengths,\" he told reporters this week about their game-planning approach.Mangini said the value of character was the main thing he took from Belichick and his New England experience. Atlas also touched on that area in his talk to the team.\"My belief is that... most knockouts are allowed. Most of them are submitted to,\" Atlas said about a fighter giving in when he is in trouble.\"You allow yourself to go to the gray room and when you're in the gray room there's a black room behind that door. And you know what that room is. You know what it represents.\"You have a chance to get out of it, because you're in the gray room. You make a choice right there. A willing choice to let yourself drift a little more to the black room and then it's done.\"Or you can make a decision to get out of there. One of the things we can control in this life is how you behave.\"Mangini wants his players to battle through adversity.\"I'd say the one thing I took away from that whole New England experience was the value of character. To me, character wins,\" the Jets coach said.\"When things are tough... those are the guys that continue to fight. If you're down a lot of points, those are the ones that continue to fight.\"", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-nfl-jets-idUSSP13981320070103", "sectors": [["Sports"]], "title": "coach mangini boxes clever to inspire jets"},

The monthly ADP National Employment Report showed that a\n40,000 decline in December was the first since early 2003,\naccording to a graph released with the report.  Private sector employers added 158,000 jobs in November and\nthe median forecast from 10 economists surveyed by Reuters had\npointed to a rise of 128,000 jobs in the December ADP report. The dollar pared earlier gains, leaving the euro EUR= down\n0.25 percent on the day after the ADP report.

The S&P 500 .SPX opened up 0.49 points at 1.418.79, with\nstock futures having pared gains on the jobs report before the\nbell. \"This is the first negative reading from ADP since early\n2003,\" HSBC U.S. economist Ian Morris said in a note to clients.\nBut he left unchanged a forecast of a rise in Friday's non-farm\npayroll count. \"We'll stick to our call of 70,000 (consensus\n120,000), which is already suggesting some softening of the\nlabor market,\" he said. Markets' reaction to the surprise fall in the ADP employment\nreport was limited, however, as investors were awaiting a key\nmeasure of manufacturing activity which could shed further light\non the timing of a possible cut in U.S. borrowing costs. The Institute for Supply Management's December reading on\nthe U.S. manufacturing sector is due at 1500 GMT. A reading\nbelow 50 on the ISM index, which dipped under the mark that\ndivides growth from contraction for the first time in 3-1/2\nyears in November, may reinforce concerns about an economic\nslowdown. Mellon Bank's head of currency research Ian Gunner noted\nthat the picture of a softer U.S. manufacturing sector had\nappeared in other data in recent weeks, with a negative\nPhiladelphia Fed balance and declines in business sales and core\ndurable goods orders.  \"Key now is whether this is just a blip or the start of\nsomething more serious and the market will be sensitive to any\nnews that offers strong support to either of these scenarios,\"\nGunner said. Minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest interest\nrate-setting meeting due at 1900 GMT were also seen casting\nlight on current thinking for the rate outlook. Fed officials have been talking tough on inflation even as\nthe market bet on rate cuts from the current 5.25 percent and\ndollar bears will be looking for any hint of a softer tone. Global market liquidity remained thinner than normal as\nJapanese markets were closed for the New Year break.

{"date": "10:17 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "NEW YORK The U.S. industrial sector expanded again in December, defying predictions for another modest contraction, according to data on Wednesday that calmed fears of a sharper slowdown in factory activity.  KEY POINTS: - The Institute for Supply Management index of national factory activity climbed to 51.4 from 49.5 in November, above the 50-threshold that separates growth from contraction. - Wall Street forecasts centered around 49.9. - The survey's employment measure was still below 50 at 49.7, but higher than November's 49.2. - The prices paid index, which measures inflation pressures at the industrial level, fell to 47.5 from 53.5, while the new orders index climbed to 52.1 from 48.7. COMMENTARY:BORIS SCHLOSSBERG, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, FOREX CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK:\"The fact that ISM came back above 50 puts the whole soft-landing, dollar-positive scenario back in play. But that said, we still think a more severe slowdown is a likely possibility. The ADP number suggests we are only starting to feel the impact of a slower economy. But this ISM report buys the dollar some breathing room for the next couple of days before the big event risk of nonfarm payrolls on Friday.\"JOHN SPINELLO, TREASURY BOND STRATEGIST, JEFFERIES & CO., NEW YORK:\"Treasuries sold off from the highs. Production was higher and new orders were higher. The market for now is focusing on the headline (ISM reading), with 10-year notes selling off about 6/32 (from price highs). It is probably enough to take a little bit of the edge off the upside, which we got on the ADP number.\"ROBERT MACINTOSH, CHIEF ECONOMIST, EATON VANCE MANAGEMENT, BOSTON:\"The manufacturing index itself was up above October so that confirms the little bit of firming we thought we had -- it's not huge but economy seems like it has firmed. The fact the price index is down is good news, offsetting negativeness of overall number. For the Fed it's a small piece of data but everything else being equal, this would make them hold off from a cut. The service (index) is 5/6 of economy and will get more attention.\"PIERRE ELLIS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK:\"The rebound in the ISM is broad-based, spanning the important subcomponents and that's significant because it begins to reverse several months' decline in those indexes. Since the ISM is a turning point indicator, we're seeing the downswing reversed. So the apparent slowdown in manufacturing seems more moderate than might have been feared and the breadth of the increase is probably a bit greater than generally looked for. That makes the general economy look steadier and even firmer than it was thought to be.\"Much the same message is given by the construction spending numbers where you see an ongoing and unsurprising decline in residential spending, but what had appeared to be a deterioration in private non-residential spending is now decisively reversed, reducing a drag on fourth-quarter growth.\"The Fed has no new reason to be concerned about the downside to economic growth and the situation appears to be the best of all possible worlds with inflation evidently slowing and growth stabilizing at a satisfactory rate.\" MARKET REACTION: - Bonds: U.S. Treasuries retrace session gains after ISM reading comes in stronger than expected. - Dollar: Rises to session high against the euro and yen. - Stocks: S&P 500 adds about 2 points from pre-ISM level, pushing the index back to near its session high.

Congress had rejected Ford's last-ditch efforts to boost military aid to Saigon.* Ford represented Michigan in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1949 and rose through Republican ranks to become House minority leader in the 1960s. Nixon named him vice president in 1973 after Spiro Agnew resigned the post in a corruption scandal.* He was the only U.S. president to have assumed office without winning a national election as either president or vice president. He lost to Democrat Jimmy Carter in his 1976 bid for a full term, in one of the closest U.S. elections in U.S. history.* Ford played on the University of Michigan's national championship football teams in 1932 and 1933 and turned down offers to play with the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers in the National Football League. Instead he went to Yale University, where he went to law school and served as boxing coach.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-ford-facts-idUSN0234020120070103", "sectors": [["U.S., ", "Politics"]], "title": "factbox - facts about ex - u . s . president gerald ford"},

Doctors do not expect the 78-year-old to recover.INQUIRYA year on \"... there is something unquestionably pathetic about wondering what might have been, if Sharon were still vital, still prime minister, still with us,\" commentator Bradley Burston wrote on the Web site of the Haaretz newspaper.\"Just as there is something unquestionably pathetic about the way Israel is, without him.\"A government-appointed commission is looking into the way Olmert, his defense minister Amir Peretz -- a former trade union leader with no top-level military experience -- and the armed forces handled the Lebanon conflict.One million Israelis spent a month in bomb shelters under Hezbollah rocket barrages that the army failed to halt despite inflicting huge destruction on Lebanon that deepened enmity toward Israel in the Arab world.Peacemaking with the Palestinians remains stalled under Olmert -- no change from Sharon's day.But Burston wonders whether Sharon, a savvy political strategist who won two terms as prime minister, might have persuaded Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to postpone last January's election in which Hamas came to power.Hamas's defeat of the moderate Abbas's long-dominant Fatah faction clouded hopes for a revival of peace efforts after Sharon pulled Israeli troops and settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005 in a move that won wide public support.\"(Israelis) trusted him, almost blindly -- (believing) Sharon knows what to do,\" Gissin said.A popular joke has been making the rounds among Israelis as they await the findings of the Lebanon war inquiry and investigations into an Olmert real estate deal, his role in the sale of a bank and appointments to a business authority.It goes like this:Sharon wakes up from his coma and is told he is no longer prime minister.\"So who replaced me?\" he asks.\"Ehud Olmert.\"\"Olmert? What will happen if war breaks out? He doesn't know how to run the army,\" Sharon says. \"So who is defense minister?\"\"Peretz\".\"That old man is still alive?\" Sharon asks.\"No, not Shimon Peres. Peretz. Amir Peretz,\" Sharon is told.\"What? I close my eyes for a minute and you guys let a trade union leader take over the defense of the country ...

The Institute for Supply Management said its index of\nnational factory activity climbed to 51.4 from 49.5 in November\n-- above the 50-threshold that separates growth from\ncontraction. Wall Street forecasts had centered around 49.9. The figures suggested the economy would kick off the year\non a stronger footing than some had believed. \"The apparent slowdown in manufacturing seems more moderate\nthan might have been feared,\" said Pierre Ellis, senior\neconomist at Decision Economics. \"That makes the general\neconomy look steadier and even firmer than it was thought to\nbe.\" All news was not positive, however, with the survey's\nemployment measure still below 50 at 49.7, albeit slightly\nhigher than November's 49.2.

The Washington Research Foundation, which markets technology\nfrom the University of Washington, is seeking damages from the\nthree mobile-phone makers for using a radio frequency receiver\ntechnology without paying royalties, according to court papers\nobtained by Reuters on Wednesday. A University of Washington scientist Edwin Suominen was\nawarded a patent in 1999 for \"simplified high-frequency\nbroadband tuner and tuning method\". Bluetooth was invented as a wire replacement by Ericsson\n(ERICb.ST) engineer Jaap Haartsen in the mid 1990s and developed\nby engineers at Ericsson and four other companies that made it\navailable at no cost through the Bluetooth Special Interest\nGroup (SIG). Haartsen told Reuters that others had previously tried\nunsuccessfully to claim part of the Bluetooth technology. \"We'll have to see how this one pans out,\" he said before\nlooking at the claim in detail. Nokia declined to comment. \"We are currently studying the\nclaims,\" said spokeswoman Eija-Riitta Huovinen. Samsung and\nPanasonic were not immediately available to comment. Bluetooth was given away by Ericsson and others to create a\nglobal wireless standard to connect mobile phones, laptops,\nheadsets and other electronic gadgets wirelessly. Since the\nfirst standard was set in 1998 it has become hugely popular, and\nhundreds of millions of devices a year are produced with\nBluetooth capability. \"As they say, 'Where there is a hit, there is a writ',\" said\nanalyst Neil Mawston at market research group Strategy\nAnalytics.\n U.S. IMPACT The claim appears to restrict itself to Bluetooth devices\nsold or used in the United States, which means any ruling will\naffect around 15 to 20 percent of total global Bluetooth mobile\nphone and headset sales in the near-term, Mawston said. \"The mobile Bluetooth market in the U.S. is relatively\nimmature and it is not yet as important to vendors as, say,\nWestern Europe with 30 to 40 percent of total,\" he said. But Ben Wood, a mobile telecoms consultant at CCS Insight,\nsaid the implications for the standard could be more serious if\nthe foundation's claim is successful. \"A standard which everyone assumes to be royalty free is now\nat risk of becoming a chargeable element inside mobile phones\nand other devices,\" he said. Although the complaint, filed in the United States Western\nDistrict Court of Washington State at Seattle, was filed against\nthe three companies, it targets products containing Bluetooth\nchips from British chip maker CSR (CSR.L), which has a world\nmarket share of more than 50 percent. Cambridge-based CSR, which was not sued by the research\ngroup as it does not sell the chips directly in the U.S., said:\n\"CSR has taken advice from its attorneys. The suit is without\nmerit in relation to CSR's Bluetooth chips, and CSR will defend\nits products vigorously.\" Its shares lost as much as 6.6 percent but recovered most of\nthe early losses after its reaction. They were down 2.9 percent\nat 640 pence by 1407 GMT, but still underperforming a 0.2\npercent higher European technology index .SX8P. Nokia shares were down 0.7 percent at 1322 GMT. The suit set apart CSR rival U.S.-based Broadcom (BRCM.O),\nwhich has acquired a licence to use the radio technology, the\nWashington Research Foundation said. The foundation said it had informed the three mobile phone\nmakers about Broadcom's licence, and that they could have bought\ntheir chips from Broadcom and avoided a legal battle. \"The document is positive news for Broadcom, but negative\nfor CSR. These two are the main global players in the Bluetooth\nchip market,\" Mawston said. Broadcom shares were up 2.75 percent at $33.20. Bluetooth SIG Marketing Director Anders Edlund said he could\nnot yet comment on the validity of the court case.\n (Additional reporting by Marc Jones in London and Tarmo Virki\nin Helsinki)\n\n\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/bluetooth-patent-infringement-idUSL0313940620070103", "sectors": [], "title": "update 2 - u . s . group sues nokia , samsung over bluetooth"},

Eight of the composite's 10 main groups advanced. But the\nheavyweight materials sector, which includes gold miners, and\nthe energy sector lost 1.42 percent and 1.75 percent,\nrespectively. The key groups' declines reflected softness in their\nunderlying commodity prices. Oil fell below $60 a barrel as\nwarm weather in the United States ate into heating oil demand. Base metals also fell, dragged down by copper prices which\ntouched their lowest levels since early April. Oil and base metals are \"the two areas where you have\nliquid, traded contracts that can be easily speculated in,\"\nGraham said. Speculation can add to market volatility. Zinc giant Teck Cominco Ltd. (TCKb.TO) was among the\nbiggest losers, dropping C$2.95, or 3.4 percent, to C$82.98.\nEnergy giant EnCana Corp. (ECA.TO) eased 90 Canadian cents to\nC$53.45. Inmet Mining IMN.TO dove C$4.29, or 7 percent, to\nC$56.49. Trading volumes are only beginning to return to normal\nlevels following the Christmas and New Year holiday break. As well, U.S. traders are back at their desks for the first\ntime this week following a day of mourning for former U.S.\nPresident Gerald Ford which kept stock exchanges south of the\nborder closed on Tuesday.

Nasrallah declined on security grounds.Nasrallah held talks with Egypt's ambassador to Lebanon on Saturday on the first such meeting since Hezbollah was founded in the early 1980s. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, a key U.S. ally, has also criticized Hezbollah in recent months.Kassem said on Monday he saw little chance of an early end to the standoff with Siniora's government, adding that the opposition would meet soon to decide how to press its campaign, now focused on a demand for early parliamentary elections.Supporters of Hezbollah and its Shi'ite and Christian allies have been camped out in central Beirut since December 1 to demand that Siniora's anti-Syrian government step down and allow early parliamentary elections to take place.Hezbollah, which is backed by Damascus and Tehran, says the campaign will remain peaceful.All Shi'ite ministers quit the cabinet in November, upsetting its sectarian balance and leaving it dominated by Sunnis, Christians and Druze opposed to Syrian influence.The opposition says Siniora's government, in power since elections that followed the withdrawal of Syrian troops in 2005, is illegitimate without Shi'ite representation.Many Lebanese fear the crisis could spark Sunni-Shi'ite violence. One anti-government Shi'ite protester was killed in early December. Another Shi'ite was found shot dead in east Lebanon last month in what Hezbollah says was a politically motivated attack.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-lebanon-hezbollah-saudi-idUSL0313236420070103", "sectors": [], "title": "hezbollah holds talks with saudi king : source"},

NTBK.O said on\nWednesday it sold 6.5 million shares privately for $3.90 each,\nwell below their closing price on Friday, in a move that pulled\nthe company's public shares as much as 12.3 percent lower. The issuance is generating about $23.7 million of funds for\nNetBank, which has not posted a profit since the fourth quarter\nof 2005. The online bank and mortgage lender plans to use the\nproceeds for regular business activities. NetBank is struggling to grow amid a difficult interest\nrate environment for banks. The short-term rates at which banks\nborrow are very close to the long-term rates at which they\nlend, which shrinks margins. NetBank's growth may also be limited by the fact that it\nmainly works with consumers online, said Peyton Green, an\nanalyst at FTN Midwest Securities in Nashville. Most major U.S.\nbanks offer online banking, but most are also boosting their\nbranch networks to serve customers who want to work with\nhumans. Younger consumers are more comfortable with Internet\nbanking, but older customers, who tend to have more assets,\noften prefer banking at branches, \"There's a place for Internet banking, but the question is,\nhow big can an Internet-only bank be?\" Green said. NetBank's shares were down 24 cents at $4.40 in morning\ntrading on the Nasdaq stock exchange, after falling to as low\nas $4.07.

More than 25 incidents were reported.The 244 pages of documents were released on the FBI's Web site on Tuesday and were turned over to the American Civil Liberties Union as part of its lawsuit.\"The FBI believes this or substantially similar information has already been released in this litigation,\" the agency said.In one incident in October of 2002, a detainee was put in a plywood hut, where interrogators yelled and screamed at him, according to the documents. One military interrogator squatted over the Koran which \"incensed\" the prisoner, the document said.The Pentagon has said the population of the prison now stands at approximately 395 inmates. Most were captured during the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan after the September 11 attacks.Another day, an FBI employee was taken to an interrogation room and saw a detainee with a full beard whose head was wrapped in duct tape.In another incident, a civilian contractor asked an FBI special agent to see a detainee who was gagged with duct tape that covered much of his head. The contractor said the prisoner had been chanting the Koran nonstop, according to the documents.The FBI said the survey found no evidence that its employees mistreated detainees. An FBI spokesman said the information from the survey has been turned over the Defense Department's inspector general.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-guantanamo-fbi-idUSN0339184120070103", "sectors": [["U.S."]], "title": "fbi : guantanamo interrogator squatted over koran"},

{"date": "11:30 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "NEW YORK U.S. mortgage applications rose last week, led by increased demand for home purchase loans even as interest rates climbed for a fourth consecutive week, an industry trade group said on Wednesday.The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity, which includes both refinance and purchase loans, for the week ended December 29 increased 3.6 percent to 575.6. The index stood at 555.8 in the previous week, which was its lowest level since early August.Applications were 5.4 percent above their year-ago level.The indexes tend to be volatile on a weekly basis, analysts say. However, the monthly average shows a decline in the volume of applications for home loans, with the four-week moving average of mortgage applications down 2.8 percent.Jim Svinth, chief economist at LendingTree.com, an online company that matches consumers with lenders, said the slim difference between the borrowing costs for some fixed- and floating-rate loan types has been luring consumers.\"While we expect interest rates to stay relatively flat for the next couple of quarters, it's interesting to note that the spread between fixed and adjustable rate mortgages is the tightest it's been since December 2000,\" he said.\"This represents a real opportunity for borrowers to shift from adjustable to fixed rate loans,\" said Svinth, who is based in Irvine, California.Borrowing costs on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, excluding fees, averaged 6.22 percent, up 0.10 percentage point from the previous week. Four weeks earlier, 30-year mortgage rates were at 5.98 percent, the lowest level since October 2005.Interest rates were also above year-ago levels of 6.15 percent.The MBA's seasonally adjusted purchase index, widely considered a timely gauge of U.S. home sales, rose 4.3 percent to 406.9. However, the purchase index was below its year-ago level of 418.3, a drop of 2.7 percent.Demand for home refinancing loans also strengthened as the MBA's seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications increased 2.2 percent to 1,640.4, up 20.3 percent from a year ago. This followed two consecutive weeks of sharp declines.The refinance share of applications decreased to 48.1 percent from 48.8 percent the previous week.FAREWELL TO ARMSIn the past adjustable-rate mortgages, known as ARMs, have been a refuge for cash-strapped consumers seeking to buy a home with low initial mortgage payments.But the ARM share of activity decreased to 20.4 percent from 23.1 percent the previous week, its lowest since July 2003.Fixed 15-year mortgage rates averaged 5.93 percent, up from 5.84 percent. Rates on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) decreased to 5.84 percent from 5.87 percent.The MBA's report precedes separate data this week gauging the state of the U.S. housing market.The National Association of Realtors will release data on pending sales of existing U.S. homes in November on Thursday.U.S. housing industry indexes, in general, tend to be volatile and in recent months they have painted a mixed picture, with some pointing to weakening and others to stabilization.The MBA's survey covers about 50 percent of all U.S. retail residential loans. Respondents include mortgage banks, commercial banks and thrifts.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-usa-mortgages-mba-idUSN0335443320070103", "sectors": [["Bonds"]], "title": "home loan demand rises despite higher rates"},

At 10:28 a.m. EST (1528 GMT), gold for February delivery\nGCG7 on the COMEX metals trading division of the New York\nMercantile Exchange was up $6.10 at $644.0 an ounce, near its\nfour-week high of $648.80. It traded in a range between $635.10\nand $647.30. James Quinn, commodity commentator at A.G.

Quinn added that Iran's nuclear saber-rattling and Nigeria's\noil-supply disturbance could continue to extend support to gold\nprices for weeks, or even longer. Militant attacks at Nigeria's Agip Tebidaba oil field, a key\nexport facility, have disrupted output for the last two months.\nKidnappings and attacks on oil facilities have become an almost\nweekly occurrence in the world's eighth-largest exporter. \"In the gold, it looks like there's some renewed buying\ninterest as the new year starts.

Shares of Cytokinetics rose 12 percent on news of its deal\nwith Amgen, one of the world's largest biotechnology companies\nthat is best known for its drugs to treat anemia and to boost\nimmune systems of chemotherapy patients. During the initial two-year term of the partnership,\nCytokinetics will be obliged to conduct and pay for research of\nits compounds that have not yet reached clinical trials, as\nwell as to finance its own continued development of a product\ncalled CK-1827452 that has completed two early-stage trials. Cytokinetics is receiving an up-front fee of $42 million,\nthe two California-based companies said in a joint release. In\naddition, Amgen has purchased nearly 3.5 million Cytokinetics\nshares for $33 million. That translates into a price of $9.47\nper share, or about 27 percent higher than its Friday closing\nshare price. Heart failure is a hard-to-treat condition in which the\nheart -- damaged by clogged arteries or other causes -- is\nunable to adequately pump blood to the rest of the body. Few\ndrugs are now able to treat the life-threatening condition,\nwhich is a major cause of disability and hospitalizations among\nthe elderly. Cytokinetics is attempting to develop synthetic drugs,\nincluding CK-1827452, that prompt weakened heart muscle to\ncontract, by activating a family of proteins called myosins. \"Joint research activities will focus on identifying and\ncharacterizing activators of cardiac myosin as back-up and\nfollow-on potential drug candidates to CK-1827452,\" the\ncompanies said in the release. Amgen has an option to help develop and sell CK-1827452,\nassuming the synthetic compound meets goals of planned\nmid-stage trials. Cytokinetics also may receive milestone payments of up to\n$600 million on CK-1827452 and other products arising from the\nresearch as well as royalties, the companies said.

PARD.O\nsaid it plans to begin a key late-stage trial of its\nexperimental lung cancer treatment picoplatin after receiving\nregulatory approval, and its shares rose 7 percent. The company said it received a special protocol assessment\n(SPA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the phase\nIII trial of picoplatin for the treatment of small cell lung\ncancer (SCLC). The pharmaceutical company said it plans to start the\nlate-stage study of picoplatin efficacy after relapse in the\nfirst half of 2007, based on positive interim mid-stage data\nfor the platinum therapy announced earlier. \"In our view, this SPA underscores the unmet clinical need\nthat is SCLC and provides added assurance that the FDA will\napprove picoplatin for this indication if (the phase III\ntrial's) primary endpoints are met,\" analyst George Zavoico of\nCantor Fitzgerald said in a research note. Zavoico, who has a \"buy\" rating and a $9 price target on\nthe stock, however, cautioned that mid-stage trial results\nmight not be repeated in later stages. A special protocol assessment provides for the FDA to\nevaluate within 45 days some late-stage trial protocols to see\nif they meet scientific and regulatory requirements. \"This SPA agreement with the FDA solidifies our plan to\nconduct a single pivotal Phase 3 trial that evaluates overall\nsurvival as the primary endpoint...\" Jerry McMahon, Poniard's\nchief executive, said in a statement. Picoplatin, the company's lead product candidate, is\ndesigned to overcome and prevent platinum resistance associated\nwith chemotherapy in solid tumors. The company said it plans to enroll about 400 patients in\nthe trial. The company expects to file a new drug application\nfor the therapy in 2009. Poniard said it had received orphan drug designation from\nthe FDA for picoplatin for the treatment of SCLC in November\n2005. An orphan drug designation encourages development of\ntreatments of rare diseases by giving the parent company seven\nyears of exclusivity to market the product for a particular\ndisease. Picoplatin was licensed to Poniard by Canadian\nbiotechnology firm AnorMED Inc. in 2004. AnorMED was acquired\nby Genzyme Corp. GENZ.O last year.

We are prepared to keep them for as long as we find them useful and after that, who knows?\" the spokesman wrote in an e-mail to Reuters.POVERTY AND NEGLECTAttacks on oil facilities and abductions of foreign oil workers have plagued the Niger Delta for years, but violence worsened in 2006.Nigeria, an OPEC member and the world's eighth-biggest exporter of crude, gets all its oil from the Niger Delta but the impoverished region of mangrove-lined creeks and swamps has long been neglected by the central and local governments.The MEND, a faceless group which emerged in late 2005, launched a series of raids on oil facilities last February which shut down a fifth of Nigeria's oil production capacity.The group captured dozens of expatriates during a series of raids in January and February last year. All were released unharmed on undisclosed terms after up to five weeks.The MEND says it will release its four captives in exchange for four prisoners in Nigerian jails: an impeached state governor, a militant leader and any two others from the delta.But the group said this was a tactic and even if its demands were met, it would only declare a temporary pause in its campaign against the oil industry.\"(These are) just demands we know the Nigerian government will find difficult to meet. More like an excuse to chase out the oil companies,\" the MEND's spokesman said.Since the abductions, the group has also detonated three car bombs in the delta's main city, Port Harcourt, prompting oil majors Shell and Total to pull out hundreds of relatives of their expatriate staff.(Additional reporting by Mathias Wildt in Milan)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-nigeria-hostages-idUSL0317814420070103", "sectors": [["World"]], "title": "nigerian militants take cash , keep foreign hostages"},

{"date": "11:53 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "(Inc.com) - After a lengthy and controversial debate, the Environmental Protection Agency has reached a compromise on what small companies are required to disclose about toxic emissions.In late 2005, the agency proposed relaxing the reporting requirements for small companies with low toxic-release volumes. Currently, all businesses possessing toxic substances must itemize their releases into the environment every year. This data constitutes the Toxic Release Inventory.Companies with fewer than 500 pounds of non-PBT (persistent, bio-accumulative, and toxic) release have been permitted to use a much abbreviated reporting form. The EPA initially proposed changes that would have allowed companies to report every other year, and extended the weight exemption for non-PBT releases to 10 times the current amount.While the amendment would have streamlined the process for both small businesses and the EPA, it eventually was rewritten because of the threat unreported toxins pose to the environment.The compromise states that annual reporting is still mandatory, and companies that release fewer than 2,000 pounds of non-PBT (instead of the proposed 5,000) can use the shortened reporting form.Over the past year, the Small Business Administration and the National Federation of Independent Business have chimed in with a series of statements and op-ed pieces explaining why the changes would benefit small businesses.In 2005, an SBA report found that the small firms pay nearly 1.5 times as much per employee as large firms do in order to comply with federal regulations.In a January op-ed piece for USA Today, Andrew Langer, manager of regulatory policy for the NFIB, called the requirement \"a paperwork regulation -- an exercise in environmental accounting and one that, for small businesses especially, is confusing, complex and incredibly time-consuming.\"The problem with current Toxic Release Inventory regulations, Langer wrote in the same op-ed, is that \"it treats the smallest of small businesses the same as it does large companies,\" ignoring \"the well-recognized disparities that exist between them.\"But both business groups now seemed pacified by the compromise. The NFIB has praised the EPA for signing the changes into effect, and in a December 18 statement, the SBA said the reform \"will help America's small businesses -- especially manufacturers -- remain competitive while still informing communities of the use of toxic materials by local firms.\"", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-inc-epa-inc-idUSN2927795020070103", "sectors": [["Small Business"]], "title": "epa relaxes reporting requirements"},
{"date": "11:55 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "OTTAWA Jan 3 Canada's robust labor market will\nlikely show signs of weakness in December, reflecting a\nsharper-than-expected slowdown in economic growth, analysts\nsaid on Wednesday. The economy added more jobs than expected in both November\nand October despite the slowdown. But the average forecast in a\nReuters poll is that a modest 10,000 jobs were created in\nDecember with the unemployment rate unchanged at 6.3 percent. The strong headline jobs numbers have masked underlying\nweaknesses. Jobs have been plentiful in resource-rich western\nCanada while lay-offs have been the norm in the powerful\ncentral provinces of Ontario and Quebec where the U.S. slowdown\nhas taken a toll on exporters. Also, all the job growth in November came from part-time\njobs while full-time positions were lost. \"I think the risk is certainly toward a pretty weak\nnumber,\" said Marc Levesque, chief fixed-income strategist at\nTD Securities. \"The data on GDP growth for the past two months has been\nsurprisingly weak and suggests the Canadian economy in the\nfourth quarter will probably have difficulty even eking out\npositive growth,\" he said. \"I'd be surprised to see Canada's\njob market continue to pump out jobs at that pace.\" In the United States, private sector employment likely\ndeclined by 40,000 in December, suggesting an abrupt slowing of\nemployment there, the monthly ADP National Employment Report\nshowed on Wednesday. Max Clarke, economist at IDEAglobal, sees downside risks to\nthe research firm's estimate of 20,000 new jobs in December,\nbecause the data are so volatile. \"You could even see a number that's single digit,\" Clarke\nsaid. \"The one thing that is difficult to measure is the change\nin part-time jobs or even as we saw recently the changes in\nfull-time jobs. The headline number itself is difficult to\ngauge when those two numbers are weighted equally.\" Whatever the jobs report reveals, the Bank of Canada is\nunlikely to be rattled. Bank Governor David Dodge has already\nacknowledged that fourth-quarter 2006 growth appears to be\nweaker than the bank had anticipated. The central bank has kept its key overnight rate steady at\n4.25 percent since May 2006 following seven straight hikes. Markets rule out any interest rate moves on Jan. 16, the\nbank's next policy announcement date, but are keen to see if\npolicymakers will change their neutral tone to reveal a bias\ntoward rate cuts later this year, as is widely expected. \"Whether or not (the jobs report) will cause them to revise\ntheir risks is going to depend on whatever data we get for the\nU.S. and Canada from this point on,\" said Levesque. For the past several months, the bank has said the risks to\nits economic outlook are balanced.\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/canada-economy-jobs-idUSN0340155920070103", "sectors": [], "title": "canada ' s slowing economy set to crimp jobs growth"},

VW's premium brand Audi (NSUG.DE), the profit driver of the\nVW group, saw its U.S. sales rise 34.6 percent in December,\nhelped by strong demand for its A3 compact, A4 mid-size and Q7\nsport utility models.

Over the whole of 2006 its U.S. vehicle\nsales rose 8.5 percent. \"2007 looks to be just as exciting,\" said Johan de Nysschen,\nAudi of America's executive vice president.

The survey that captures sales figures did not say how big the increase was for the final week of the month.SpendingPulse also said a 3.7 percent year-over-year rise in spending on gasoline in December showed consumers were increasingly taking to the road to do their shopping as the impact of lower fuel prices seemed to be taking hold after three months of slightly negative sales.\"It's good to see consumers hitting the road more, buying more gasoline,\" said Michael McNamara, vice president of research for MasterCard Advisors. \"It increases the velocity of the retail economy when you see people out there hitting the stores.\"A burst of cooler weather across the country following unseasonably warm temperatures, together with higher foot traffic from shoppers redeeming gift cards and searching for post-holiday discounts, also spurred shoppers during the last week of December, SpendingPulse said.The survey comes ahead of a report measuring total retail sales excluding automobiles for the month of December and after SpendingPulse data last week showed a 3 percent rise in holiday retail sales that compared to a year-ago 5.2 percent gain.Retailers from Federated Department Stores FD.N to Best Buy Co.

This is what I call playing games with the feelings of the victims' relatives,\" said Peter Tolitton, whose brother was aboard the ill-fated plane.\"If up to the ministerial level the information is inaccurate, we doubt the credibility of the officials,\" Tolitton, a Jakarta resident who was flown by Adam Air to Makassar, told Reuters.The missing plane was carrying 96 passengers and six crew. A copy of its manifest showed three passengers as non-Indonesians. The U.S. embassy in Jakarta said they were Americans.The renewed search effort, in the face of heavy rain and strong winds, was being coordinated from Makassar, Sulawesi's largest city, 1,400 km (875 miles) east of Jakarta.Transport Minister Hatta Radjasa said military planes had been deployed since daybreak and naval ships sent to the Makassar Strait between Sulawesi and Borneo in case the doomed plane had fallen into the sea.But as darkness set in across the search area late on Wednesday, there was no news of any sign of the plane or of a crash site.HELP FROM SINGAPORE, U.S.Indonesian military officials said the air force had deployed a helicopter and surveillance plane, the navy four aircraft, and the army nearly 300 personnel for the search and rescue effort, and that Singapore would provide a surveillance aircraft and unspecified help would come from the United States.An Indonesian air force official said aircraft were searching mountainous areas between the Sulawesi coastal town of Majene and Toraja. Much of it is covered with jungle and forest, and transportation and communication facilities can be poor.South Sulawesi governor Amin Syam said that, besides continuing bad weather, many rescuers were worn out after the efforts made on Tuesday based on the wrong data.Officials said the mistaken information about the location of wreckage and survivors had come from accounts from a local village that police then relayed to government agencies.The confusion over the missing plane highlighted the logistical difficulties of dealing with disasters, from quakes and volcanoes to floods and forest fires, in an archipelago of 17,000 islands stretched across an area about as wide as the United States.The plane lost contact with the ground on Monday about an hour before it was due to land in Manado in North Sulawesi.Transport officials have insisted the plane, which had clocked up 45,371 flying hours, was airworthy.The transport ministry said it had last evaluated the plane in December 2005, when it passed all service checks. The aircraft was due to be checked again in late January.Joseph Umar Hadi, an opposition member of the Indonesian parliament's transport commission, said annual checks on planes operated by budget carriers were \"very insufficient\".\"Crude competition among operators has created risks unknown by the public, whether it relates to maintenance or management that encourages thrift,\" he said.President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has ordered a full investigation into the condition of all commercial planes in Indonesia and what went wrong in the Adam Air case, as well as an evaluation of the nation's transportation system.For that purpose Yudhoyono would form a national team that would look at sea and air transport in particular, with an eye to safety issues, transportation minister Radjasa told reporters late on Wednesday after a meeting with the president.Adam Air's plane disappeared less than three days after a ferry capsized and sank off Indonesia's main island of Java. Hundreds who were aboard the ferry are still missing.Ferries are ubiquitous in Indonesia as an inexpensive way to travel among its many islands, while air travel has mushroomed since the industry was liberalized in the late 1990s, enabling privately owned budget airlines to operate.(With additional reporting by Muklis Ali, Mita Valina Liem and Muara Makarim in Jakarta)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-indonesia-plane-idUSJAK14943920070103", "sectors": [["World"]], "title": "anger as indonesia resumes search for airliner"},

The LNG will come from Australia's Gorgon development, said\nA. Sengupta, finance director at Indian gas firm Petronet LNG\nLtd. (PLNG.BO). The company expects a deal by end-June after negotiations\nwith the project's joint venture partners Exxon Mobil Corp.\n(XOM.N), Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L). However, spokesman Michael Barrett said Chevron, who has\nalready pre-sold almost all its Gorgon gas, was not the seller.\nBarrett said each partner was handling negotiations for sales of\nits share of Gorgon gas separately. Exxon Mobil and Shell declined comment on potential Gorgon\ngas sales discussions. Exxon Mobil has previously been linked with sales to India,\nwhile Shell has said it planned to sell all or part of its share\nof LNG from Gorgon to the North American market, via a terminal\nin Baja California, Mexico. Sengupta's comments clarified earlier remarks by Petroleum\nSecretary M.S. Srinivasan, who told reporters at a conference\nthat the gas was from Australia's North West Shelf, which may\nhave been a reference to the region that includes Gorgon, rather\nthan the North West Shelf (NWS) venture LNG project. \"Some delays due to environment concerns were there, but\nthat has been sorted out. We expect to sign a deal in the next\n60 days,\" Srinivasan said. \"It is a 25-year contract and supplies are expected to begin\nin 2011.\"\n SECURING ENERGY SUPPLIES India, which imports more than 70 percent of the fuel it\nconsumes, wants to ensure adequate supplies to sustain an\neconomy growing at more than 8 percent a year. It is also\nnegotiating LNG purchases with Iran. Srinivasan said India's domestic gas production was seen at\n200 million cubic metres a day in the next five years. Petronet\nsays India's regasification capacity for LNG -- gas super cooled\nand shipped by tanker -- stands at 10 million tonnes a year. India imposes price controls on domestic gas sales, keeping\nprices below world market levels. However, the LNG is destined\nfor industrial users such as fertiliser manufacturers and power\nstations, which will have to pay market rates. Gorgon's operator Chevron won a government green light last\nmonth for the project, which has been beset by worries over its\nenvironmental impact that have pushed back first deliveries\nuntil after the originally planned date of 2010. Chevron holds a 50 percent stake, while Exxon Mobil and\nRoyal Dutch Shell Plc each have 25 percent. Chevron has made\npreliminary agreements to sell LNG to Japanese customers,\nincluding Osaka Gas Co. Ltd. (9532.T) and Tokyo Gas Co.\n(9531.T). Gorgon is expected to have a total liquefaction capacity of\n10 million tonnes a year. The greater Gorgon area has estimated\ngas reserves of about 40 trillion cubic feet (tcf), a quarter of\nAustralia's known gas reserves. Western Australia, rich in natural gas, is home to many\nmajor LNG developments, including the North West Shelf gas field\noperated by Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL.AX). NWS currently has a production capacity of 11.6 million\ntonnes of LNG per year and will increase to 16.3 million from\nlate 2008. Woodside has been working to renew long-term supply\nagreements with Japanese customers that underpin the project. The six equal partners in the NWS joint venture are\nWoodside, BHP Billiton (BHP.AX)(BLT.L), Chevron, BP Plc (BP.L),\nJapan Australia LNG (MiMi) Pty. Ltd., a joint venture of\nMitsubishi Corp.

The dollar jumped after the Institute for Supply Management\nsaid its manufacturing index climbed to 51.4, above the 50\nthreshold that separates expansion and contraction. The\ngreenback erased losses spurred by an earlier report showing\nthe first contraction in the U.S. private sector job market\nsince April 2003. \"The fact that ISM came back above 50 puts the whole\nsoft-landing, dollar-positive scenario back in play,\" said\nBoris Schlossberg, senior currency strategist at Forex Capital\nMarkets in New York.

The euro EUR= was trading down 0.8 percent on the day at\n$1.3175, while sterling tumbled more than one percent to\n$1.9485 GBP= in its biggest daily decline since July 2005.\nThe dollar was up 0.7 percent at 119.63 yen JPY= after\nreaching as high as 119.65 on electronic trading platform EBS. Earlier in the session, the dollar had given up some ground\nafter a survey showed employment in the U.S. private sector\ncontracted unexpectedly in December. The ADP National Employment Report showed private-sector\njobs likely declined 40,000 in the month, flying in the face of\nconsensus forecasts for a solid rise. The soft report led some traders to speculate that the more\nclosely watched nonfarm payrolls report -- due from the\ngovernment on Friday -- could also come in softer than\nexpectations. \"It points to a pretty poor payroll number on Friday, so I\nthink we'll see some revisions to the expectations for that\nnumber,\" said Shaun Osborne, senior currency strategist at TD\nSecurities in Toronto. A weak reading in that payrolls report would likely\nstrengthen the view that the Federal Reserve may start cutting\ninterest rates in coming months to shore up a slowing economy. However, in the wake of the higher-than-expected ISM\nreading, the futures market is pricing in only a 12 percent\nchance of a rate cut by March, down from 18 percent in early\ntrading.

{"date": "12:30 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "WASHINGTON Parents, pick up your pencils. It's time to fill out the financial aid forms that may get you some help with those arrhythmia-inducing tuition bills.It's a great time to ask for financial aid. Federal and local governments and colleges have been giving out some $135 billion a year, according to the College Board. And Congressional Democrats say they are going to make aid more plentiful and college loans more affordable when they take control of Capitol Hill this week.So, get the paperwork in for your fledgling fall freshman. Here's how.-- First, position yourself.Savings in your children's name penalizes their aid award far more than savings in 529 plans do. A loophole in the law allows you to clean out your kid's account and put the money in a 529 plan. Do that now, before you fill out and sign the aid forms. Some states will give you a tax break for that 529 deposit, even if you pull the money out next year to pay for that first semester.Financial aid formulas similarly put your retirement savings off limits but not your regular savings. So make your 2006 IRA contribution before you finish the forms.-- Then file fast.Though they may claim they don't, some schools give more money to early birds. Their financial aid offices start out generously and then, if they perceive themselves running low of funds, get a bit more tight-fisted later in the application cycle.You can, and should, file your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) before the end of January, even if you don't have exact figures for your 2006 income and tax situation. You can always amend your form. Don't wait for the July 31 federal deadline, because states and individual schools have their own deadlines that may be earlier.-- Check with all the schools your child applied to and find out whether they require any other forms.Many private schools also require the College Board's PROFILE form (profileonline.collegeboard.com), and some might have their own forms, as well.-- Apply online, as do 90 percent of financial aid applicants.Do that at fafsa.ed.gov. The online version of the form is slightly different than the printed version, and allows you to forward the form to more schools. It also collects information about students who might qualify for a new federal grant program for low-income high achievers. The paper form doesn't.-- Make sure all the schools get your forms.This year's online FAFSA allows you to list six schools to receive the forms. But you can add additional schools and should, so that every college that got an application from your child also gets financial aid forms.-- Try to DIY.There are many professionals who are willing to fill out the forms for you for a fee, but it's not that hard, says Tom Joyce of student lending firm Sallie Mae.His firm offers an informational Web site with instructions and checklists to make it easier at collegeanswer.com. It's free to file the FAFSA, so you shouldn't fill out the form at a Web site that charges you for filing, he says.-- Don't limit your child until you see all of the financial aid offers.You may think that you make too much to qualify for aid, but you may be wrong. Some private schools with large endowments hand out big money even to well-heeled kids. Fill out the forms, even if you don't expect much, and maybe you'll be pleasantly surprised come April, when aid awards are announced.\"The stakes are high and getting higher every year,\" says Joyce. \"Parents and students need to make sure they get the form filled out early and take advantage of all the free money.\"", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-column-finance-idUSN15253920070103", "sectors": [], "title": "the facts on filing those fall freshman aid forms"},

(WMT.N) is moving workers to a new advanced scheduling system, building on a pilot program it tested last year that schedules hourly employees based on the number of shoppers in a store.\"This is exactly what we were piloting before, and it has been introduced to cashiers and customer service positions,\" Wal-Mart spokeswoman Sarah Clark said.The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that Wal-Mart will start moving many of its 1.3 million workers from predictable shifts to a system based on how many customers are in stores at a given time.Wal-Mart said last year that it was testing the system as it looks to cut labor costs. Clark said Wal-Mart plans to move all hourly workers to the new system this year.Critics contend the advanced system takes hours away from full-time employees and demands more flexibility from workers.\"You are saying to workers who are already getting paid poorly ... if you want any hours, you have to agree to work when we want you to work and to agree to a schedule that changes,\" said Chris Kofinis, spokesman for WakeUpWalMart.com, which has pressured Wal-Mart to improve pay and benefits.But Clark said the retailer does not have \"open availability,\" meaning workers are available to work 24 hours a day, seven days a week. She said no hours have been cut or reduced as part of the new scheduling system.Wal-Mart said the new system ensures that stores are fully staffed at peak shopping times and it takes into account the hours employees prefer to work.\"It is much friendlier and more predictable than the previous system in that it actually asks for our associates preferences of when they prefer to work,\" Clark said.She said under the old system, store managers drew up schedules based on the level of sales in a store. Now, increased staffing will coincide with times when customer traffic surges, she said.Clark said employee schedules are now available three weeks in advance, while under old system, schedules were posted two to three weeks in advance.Clark said the size of the pilot program was \"significant,\" but she did not have numbers on how many employees were included in the pilot.The Journal report said other retailers such as Payless ShoeSource Inc. PSS.N and RadioShack Corp. RSH.N are also using advanced scheduling systems.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-walmart-scheduling-idUSN0326626020070103", "sectors": [], "title": "wal - mart moving employees to new schedule system"},

{"date": "12:40 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "AMSTERDAM A U.S. research institute has sued Nokia (NOK1V.HE), Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Matsushita-owned (6752.T) Panasonic for violating a patent for Bluetooth technology, potentially putting the free wireless standard at risk.The Washington Research Foundation, which markets technology from the University of Washington, is seeking damages from the three mobile-phone makers for using a radio frequency receiver technology without paying royalties, according to court papers obtained by Reuters on Wednesday.A University of Washington scientist Edwin Suominen was awarded a patent in 1999 for \"simplified high-frequency broadband tuner and tuning method\".Bluetooth was invented as a wire replacement by Ericsson (ERICb.ST) engineer Jaap Haartsen in the mid 1990s and developed by engineers at Ericsson and four other companies that made it available at no cost through the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG).Haartsen told Reuters that others had previously tried unsuccessfully to claim part of the Bluetooth technology.\"We'll have to see how this one pans out,\" he said before looking at the claim in detail.Nokia declined to comment. \"We are currently studying the claims,\" said spokeswoman Eija-Riitta Huovinen. Samsung and Panasonic were not immediately available to comment.Bluetooth was given away by Ericsson and others to create a global wireless standard to connect mobile phones, laptops, headsets and other electronic gadgets wirelessly. Since the first standard was set in 1998 it has become hugely popular, and hundreds of millions of devices a year are produced with Bluetooth capability.\"As they say, 'Where there is a hit, there is a writ',\" said analyst Neil Mawston at market research group Strategy Analytics.U.S. IMPACTThe claim appears to restrict itself to Bluetooth devices sold or used in the United States, which means any ruling will affect around 15 to 20 percent of total global Bluetooth mobile phone and headset sales in the near-term, Mawston said.\"The mobile Bluetooth market in the U.S. is relatively immature and it is not yet as important to vendors as, say, Western Europe with 30 to 40 percent of total,\" he said.But Ben Wood, a mobile telecoms consultant at CCS Insight, said the implications for the standard could be more serious if the foundation's claim is successful.\"A standard which everyone assumes to be royalty free is now at risk of becoming a chargeable element inside mobile phones and other devices,\" he said.Although the complaint, filed in the United States Western District Court of Washington State at Seattle, was filed against the three companies, it targets products containing Bluetooth chips from British chip maker CSR (CSR.L), which has a world market share of more than 50 percent.Cambridge-based CSR, which was not sued by the research group as it does not sell the chips directly in the U.S., said: \"CSR has taken advice from its attorneys. The suit is without merit in relation to CSR's Bluetooth chips, and CSR will defend its products vigorously.\"Its shares lost as much as 6.6 percent but recovered most of the early losses after its reaction. They were down 2.9 percent at 640 pence by 1407 GMT, but still underperforming a 0.2 percent higher European technology index .SX8P.Nokia shares were down 0.7 percent at 1322 GMT.The suit set apart CSR rival U.S.-based Broadcom (BRCM.O), which has acquired a license to use the radio technology, the Washington Research Foundation said.The foundation said it had informed the three mobile phone makers about Broadcom's license, and that they could have bought their chips from Broadcom and avoided a legal battle.\"The document is positive news for Broadcom, but negative for CSR. These two are the main global players in the Bluetooth chip market,\" Mawston said.Broadcom shares were up 2.75 percent at $33.20.Bluetooth SIG Marketing Director Anders Edlund said he could not yet comment on the validity of the court case.(Additional reporting by Marc Jones in London and Tarmo Virki in Helsinki)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-bluetooth-patent-infringement-idUSL0369104520070103", "sectors": [["Tech"]], "title": "u . s . group sues nokia , samsung over bluetooth"},

He says he could make much more money giving up his mostly low-value businesses and renting out the spaces to foreign luxury brands.\"But then what else would I do with my days?\" he said.FOREIGNERS COMPLAINTraders say jeans company Lee Cooper was the first international brand to move in the early 1990s, when India began to open up its economy to foreign investment.Lee Cooper has since left, but clothing brands Levi Strauss & Co., Nike and the United Colours of Benetton, along with Subway and McDonald's restaurants, are some of the dozen or so international companies to be found here.Swarovski, the Austrian crystal company, had been trying to get into Khan Market for more than three years before it bagged a tenancy here in April.The company pays 350,000 rupees ($7,830) a month in rent for 434 square feet of shop space, said Vishnu Sharma, one of Swarovski's Indian partners. He wishes he got smarter surroundings for the money.\"They do complain about how the market is so shabby looking, or foreign customers do anyway,\" he said. \"Indians are used to it ... I would love to see Khan Market look more like Fifth Avenue.\"But Sheila Dikshit, Delhi's chief minister, says she is in no rush to see it made over.\"It may not be very chic or smart,\" she told Reuters, \"but it's got a warmth you don't find in many places any more.\"", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-india-property-shopping-idUSDEL30195620070103", "sectors": [], "title": "buckets , fine crystal for sale on india ' s 5th avenue"},
{"date": "13:12 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "LONDON These are tough times for bond investors, with equities showing no sign of cooling and the U.S. and global economies still too robust to persuade central bankers to cut interest rates.A stronger-than-expected U.S. manufacturing report on Wednesday will have done little to cheer those hoping for the Federal Reserve to ease soon.It adds to the hawkish sentiment in the euro zone, Britain and Japan.New figures from Citigroup, meanwhile, confirm what many already suspected -- that most substantial gains on government bonds last year came from foreign exchange plays, not the underlying debt itself.The investment bank's benchmark index of mainly developed government bonds showed returns of just 0.71 percent in 2006 in local currency terms. Compare that with an 18.78 percent rise on the MSCI all-country world stock index .MSCI.At a more detailed level, U.S. Treasuries returned 3.12 percent in dollar terms, British gilts just 0.50 percent in sterling, and Japanese government bonds 0.30 percent in yen. Euro zone bonds lost 0.42 percent for euro holders.The Citigroup indexes suggest, however, that unhedged dollar investors had a better time of it. For them, Britain returned 14.57 percent, and the euro zone 11.32 percent.The spreads, of course, came courtesy of the weakening dollar, which declined around 8.5 percent against a basket of currencies =USD during the year and more than that against the likes of the euro EUR= and pound GBP=.But similar benefits will have accrued to unhedged dollar investors making equity plays overseas, meaning that even those who got the more robust gains from bonds could have done far better on many of the world's bourses.BAD NEWS, GOOD NEWSSo what about this year? Investors have entered 2007 clearly expecting more of the same for now.Reuters asset allocation polls  showed bond holdings at the end of December were higher than 12 months previously, but below highs of the past two years.U.S., continental European and British investors were all underweight in bonds and expecting to stay that way for at least three months. A Merrill Lynch poll showed 65 percent of fund managers were underweight bonds.The key for bonds this year likely will be how much the U.S. economy slows and whether this translates into central banks lowering interest rates globally.The European Central Bank and central banks of England and Japan are showing no such proclivity whatsoever and are instead leaning toward hikes.Prospects for U.S. rates under the Federal Reserve have been different following its pause after a long tightening cycle. But any hopes for near-term easing probably went out the window with Wednesday's manufacturing data.Futures markets are pricing in roughly 50 basis points of Fed easing this year, which would take the fed funds rate down to 4.75 percent. Only a month ago, however, futures were discounting 75 basis points of rate cuts.The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index for December bounced back to 51.4 from 49.5 in November. Readings above 50 denote expansion in the sector and readings below denote contraction.Research by investment bank HSBC economists Ian Morris and Ryan Wang earlier in the week noted that an ISM below 50 usually stays that way for eight or nine months and presages a Fed easing phase.HSBC is projecting a sharper-than-expected U.S. slowdown and five Fed rate cuts by the end of the year.The rub for bond investors is that even in this rate-cutting scenario, the bank researcher saw already relatively low long-end U.S. bond yields dropping less than half a point from current levels -- hardly a bonanza.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-markets-bonds-performance-idUSL0310814120070103", "sectors": [], "title": "woes look set to stay for bond investors"},

Morgan analyst Himanshu Patel said in a note to clients.Patel, who has an \"overweight\" rating on Goodyear, also said the company likely would look to close a non-union plant in North America to meet its goal for capacity cuts, and also may trim non-union health-care and pension benefits.Deutsche Bank upgraded Goodyear to \"buy\" from \"hold\" on Tuesday, mainly due to much-larger-than-expected projected cost savings from the new labor contract. It said this addressed some of its long-term concerns about the tire maker's competitiveness.Goodyear expects up to $610 million in savings under the three-year contract, and $300 million of annual savings thereafter.

They put aside the team from the Interior Ministry that was supposed to carry it out,\" the official said.An official execution video, which had no sound and ended before Saddam falls through the trapdoor, boosted Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's authority among his fractious Shi'ite allies.But the mobile phone images have hardened perceptions among Saddam's disillusioned fellow Sunnis about triumphant Shi'ites and dealt a blow to Maliki's efforts for reconciliation.U.S. SAYS IT HAD NO ROLEThe U.S. military, which had kept physical custody of Saddam for three years until he was handed to Iraqis minutes before the execution, said on Wednesday it had no role in the hanging but that it would have handled it differently.\"Had we been physically in charge at that point we would have done things differently,\" U.S. military spokesman Major General William Caldwell told a news conference in Baghdad.Caldwell said U.S. forces left all security measures at Saddam's execution, including searching witnesses for mobile phones, to Iraqi authorities. He said U.S. troops immediately left the building where Saddam was executed after handing him over at 5:30 a.m., 25 minutes after he left his U.S. prison on a 10-minute helicopter ride to the execution site.\"We had absolutely nothing to do with the facility where the execution took place,\" Caldwell said.Rubaie said he handed over his mobile phone before boarding a U.S. helicopter that transported an official delegation of a little more than a dozen people from the Green Zone government compound to the execution.Prosecutor Munkith al-Faroon, who also attended the execution and told Reuters he saw two senior government officials film the hanging with their mobiles, said on Wednesday the taunts came from guards who were outside the chamber.\"These shouts were spontaneous.

{"date": "13:34 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " (Adds analyst's comments, details and background) QUITO Jan 3 (Reuters) - Ecuador's incoming government is considering forcing bondholders to accept a buyback of the country's global bonds due in 2012 by threatening not to pay interest, Economy Minister designate Ricardo Patino said on Wednesday.     Patino, who was named by President-elect Rafael Correa as his economy minister, was asked if he had considered announcing that the government would not pay interest to force creditors to accept a buyback to be managed through a Dutch auction.     \"This is an alternative and we are studying several alternatives,\" answered Patino in a television program, without giving more details.     A Dutch auction starts with an asking price that moves downward until it is accepted by a bidder.     In a later news conference, Patino distanced himself from his earlier comments, saying Ecuador has \"a thousand options\" to manage the country's debt.     \"We have to see if there are resources to pay debt interests,\" he told reporters. \"If we have it, we will pay it, and if not, we will call creditors.\"     Patino said he was earlier answering a question about restructuring options and reiterated the suspension of payments was only one of many alternatives.     Correa, who will be sworn in as president on Jan. 15, has caused jitters on Wall street with threats to interrupt bond payments as he seeks to lower the country's debt burden.     \"These kind of comments just add to the ambiguity surrounding the outlook of Ecuador and its debt,\" said Gianfranco Bertozzi, an analyst with Lehman Brothers in New York.     \"Markets in the last several weeks have began to price in a suspension of payments ... The risk of a default event seems at 50 percent or greater as priced in by the market at the moment,\" he added.     Some Wall Street analysts say Correa will strike a more market-friendly stance once in office.     \"The market has seen these comments as a possibility that they will not call a default,\" said Marjorie Hernandez, a Latin America analyst at HSBC Securities.     Patino's comments show that the incoming government is looking for other ways to manage the debt instead of calling a default, she said.     The yield spread between Ecuador's global bonds and comparable U.S. Treasuries tightened on Wednesday by 22 basis points to 900 basis points, according to J.P. Morgan's Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus 11EMJ .JPMEMBIPLUS.     On Tuesday, Correa said his government may adjust its debt service payments if the $900 million left in arrears by the current government generates budgetary problems this year.     Correa has vowed to restructure all of the Andean country's commercial, bilateral and multilateral debt. Ecuador's public foreign debt totaled $10.3 billion in November, according to the Economy Ministry.

{"date": "13:35 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "NEW YORK Retired microbiologist Diana Westmoreland is no stranger to technology -- except when it comes to computers.\"The programs are intimidating. The language that's used is a foreign one to me,\" said Westmoreland, who lives near Cardiff, Wales. \"I'm the sort of person who, when something crashes, apologizes to the screen.\"The problem, says consultant David Platt, lies not with the user but with the programmers, who just don't think like the people who use their products.Platt is a computer science instructor at the Harvard University Extension School and the author of a new book called \"Why Software Sucks ... And What You Can Do About It,\" published by Pearson Plc unit Pearson Education.One of his peeves is when a text-editing program like Microsoft Word asks users if they want to save their work before they close their document.That question makes little sense to computer novices accustomed to working with typewriters or pen and paper, he said. For them, a clearer question would be: \"Throw away everything you've just done?\"Boxes that ask users to confirm whether they want to take a step such as deleting a document are another example of what he calls a bad feature.\"Your car does not ask, 'Do you really want to start the engine?' when you turn the key,\" Platt said.The confirmation box has become so overused that no one pays any attention to it, even when it's warning about a document that should be kept, he said.Error messages represent software communication at its worst, Platt said. In his book, he recounts how after trying to save a Web page from his Internet browser, he received a message that said it couldn't be done and gave him no other recourse but to hit the OK button.\"No, it is not OK with me that this operation didn't work and the program can't explain why,\" he wrote.YOUR.USER.IS.NOT.YOU.Platt, who has also written nine books for computer professionals, has a message for software developers: \"Your. User. Is. Not. You.\"People who write software programs value control. The user, on the other hand, just wants something that's easy to operate.To illustrate his point, he notes that computer programmers tend to prefer manual transmissions. But not even 15 percent of the cars sold in the United States last year had that feature.Similarly, many software programs come with functions -- like the ability to move the menu bar -- that the average person does not want or need. Programing instructions required for such features, Platt said, \"increase the possibility of crashing errors and security vulnerabilities in the same way as more moving parts on any mechanical device render it less reliable.\"David Thomas, executive director of the Software & Information Industry Association's software division, disputed Platt's assessment of computer programmers.According to Thomas, the trouble with software programs is that good ones often get overloaded with features demanded by \"power users,\" such as big corporations or vocal individuals.\"You don't want your customers to design your product,\" he said. \"They're really bad at it.\"As more and more software becomes Internet-based, he said, companies can more easily monitor their users' experiences and improve their programs with frequent updates.They have a financial incentive to do so, since more consumer traffic results in higher subscription or advertising revenues.\"They know that if they don't make the customer experience enjoyable that the customer will stop using them,\" he said, \"whereas if I sell you a (software) product, I don't care if you use it or not; I have your money.\"There is one area, however, where Thomas and Platt agree: the Web still has a long way to go.Too many Web sites start off with home pages that offer animation, music -- and no real information.\"Every time I want to look at an article and I have to click to get past that multimedia thing, it drives me crazy,\" Thomas said. \"They should be monitoring the fact that 99 percent of people try click on 'close' within a certain fraction of a second to get away from that thing.\"Web search company Google Inc. and photocopy chain Fedex Kinko's, a unit of Fedex Corp., provide easy-to-use Web sites, but others are still more complicated than they need to be, Platt said.Starbucks Corp. incurred his wrath because the coffee shop chain required him to specify a search radius when he was trying to use its site find the nearest store.\"The Starbucks programmers probably think that having more control over the search is powerful and cool,\" he wrote. \"But in reality it's a useless and annoying distraction. Nobody goes around asking, 'Is there a Starbucks within five miles? How about 10? 15?'\"Platt said he voiced his sentiments to Starbucks, but received only an automated response. The company did not comment for this article.While companies may not always reply, Platt urges his readers to let them know about software problems by posting feedback on their Web sites. \"The best companies want to hear from users,\" he said.He also advises consumers to check out what trustworthy software reviewers have to say about a product before they buy it and to post their own comments on Web sites that sell the programs.However, individuals can only do so much, and he is working on forming an organization called \"It Just Works\" (suckbusters.com) to laud the good programs and ridicule the bad.While Platt believes market forces are moving the software industry in the right direction, he already is thinking about writing a sequel called \"Why Software Still Sucks.\"\"I'd be astounded,\" he said in an e-mail, \"if (the industry) made so much progress in the next year or two that it might not benefit from another nudge.\"", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-software-platt-idUSN2227096620070103", "sectors": [["Science, ", "Tech"]], "title": "programmers to blame for hard - to - use software"},

{"date": "13:40 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "NEW YORK The departure of Home Depot Inc.'s (HD.N) top executive reignited takeover talk about the home improvement retailer, but analysts dismissed the idea again, saying the $100 billion company was probably too large to be bought out any time soon.Home Depot said on Wednesday that in a mutual decision, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Nardelli had resigned. The retailer was the subject last year of media and market speculation that it is ripe for a leveraged buyout.After media outlets named Kohlberg, Kravis & Roberts and Texas Pacific Group as being interested, Home Depot said in early December that it had not had any discussions about a potential buyout by private equity firms or a recapitalization.A few weeks later the company disclosed that a large activist investor firm, Relational Investors, was planning to launch a proxy fight that included the creation of a board committee that would consider strategic alternatives -- such as the sale of the company -- and management performance.But analysts, bankers and private equity investors agree there is a major obstacle to a deal: the equity and the debt that a leveraged buyout exceeding $100 billion would require.IT'S JUST TOO BIGAnd analysts said on Wednesday that while Nardelli's departure might be sparking yet another round of speculation on a possible sale -- as is often the case when a top executive leaves with little notice -- Home Depot is probably just too big.\"There have been a lot of rumors that Home Depot is a private equity play. We would not read that much into that. We just think that it's way too large of a fish to swallow,\" said Richard Steinberg, president of Steinberg Global Asset Management in Boca Raton, Florida. His firms owns shares in both Home Depot and rival Lowe's Cos. Inc. (LOW.N).A $100 billion deal would be far larger than anything yet attempted, and surpass the largest takeout ever -- KKR's $25.1 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. in 1988.Arun Daniel, a consumer analyst with ING Investments, said that LBO speculation is helping the stock, but is unrealistic.\"The LBO scenario, while the math works, from a practical perspective, it's difficult because simply the size of the financing. And based on my discussion with major bankers, it's very difficult to pull off,\" Daniel said.While real estate sales and co-investments by multiple private equity firms could help a Home Depot leveraged buyout, most bankers and private equity investors say that a $40 billion to $50 billion LBO is about all the market can handle right now.Indeed, several bankers and private equity investors told Reuters that the market is capable of handling roughly $30 billion of high yield debt and another $10 billion or so of bank debt.Since private equity firms rarely, if ever, use more than 10 percent of their funds for a single deal, and there are only a handful of funds with more than $15 billion, it would severely limit the number firms capable of doing the deal.Indeed, Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Fassler said in a research note that while its numbers show that a leveraged buyout of Home Depot makes sense in terms of returns up until the $46 level, the size of the deal is a barrier because of the limits of the financing markets.\"We therefore think an LBO is relatively unlikely,\" Fassler wrote.In the U.S. options market, many investors greeted the surprise resignation by accumulating bullish calls as they bet on more upside potential in the shares of the home improvement retailer, according to Jon Najarian, co-founder of optionmonster.com, a Web information site in Chicago.\"They are also optimistic about Home Depot's board being receptive to merger combinations and/or a leveraged buyout,\" he added.Home Depot shares rose 3.3 percent to $41.49 in New York Stock Exchange trading.During the first half of the session, roughly 39,500 calls and 9,300 puts traded in Home Depot, above its average daily volume of 39,930 contracts, according to market research firm Track Data.(Additional reporting by Michael Flaherty and Nicole Maestri in New York and Doris Frankel and Ben Klayman in Chicago)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-homedepot-nardelli-takeover-idUSN0339472320070103", "sectors": [["M&A, ", "Mutual Fund Center"]], "title": "home depot ceo ' s departure reignites takeover talk"},

(WMT.N)\nand other low-priced chains. Total sales rose 14.4 percent to $5.13 billion. Pharmacy same-store sales rose 9.6 percent, while\nsame-store sales of general, or front-end, merchandise rose 5.8\npercent. Total December pharmacy sales rose 15.6 percent, and the\nnumber of prescriptions filled at comparable stores increased\n4.8 percent. \"Walgreen's December sales showed, once again, no impact\nfrom Wal-Mart's $4 generics program,\" Goldman Sachs analyst\nJohn Heinbockel wrote in a note to clients. He has a \"neutral\"\nrating on the shares. Wal-Mart started selling certain generic drugs for $4 per\nmonthly prescription in Florida in September. By late November,\nthe program was in place at all of its 3,810 pharmacies and was\nmatched by rivals such as Target Corp. (TGT.N). But major drugstore chains such as Walgreen said consumers\nwould continue to fill prescriptions at their stores, despite\nsome higher prices, due to their convenient locations and\ncustomer service. Walgreen and its rivals have not matched\nWal-Mart's $4 strategy. Walgreen said that having an extra weekend day and one\nfewer weekday in December compared with a year earlier hurt\ncomparable pharmacy sales by 2.7 percentage points. Customers\ntend to fill more prescriptions on weekdays than weekends, and\nDecember 2006 had an additional Sunday and one fewer Thursday\ncompared with December 2005. Pharmacy sales accounted for 56.8 percent of sales in the\nmonth, Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreen said. Walgreen has higher annual sales than rival CVS Corp.\n(CVS.N) but fewer stores. CVS operated 6,197 stores as of Nov.\n25, while Walgreen had 5,584 stores as of Dec. 31. Shares of Walgreen were up 35 cents, or 0.76 percent, at\n$46.24 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange\nafter rising as high as $46.69 earlier in the day.

{"date": "14:08 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " (Adds indicator date, details on Canadian dollar) By Louise EganOTTAWA Jan 3 (Reuters) - Canada's robust labor market will\nlikely show signs of weakness in December, reflecting a\nsharper-than-expected slowdown in economic growth, analysts\nsaid on Wednesday. The economy added more jobs than expected in both November\nand October despite the slowdown. But the average forecast in a\nReuters poll is that a modest 10,000 jobs were created in\nDecember with the unemployment rate unchanged at 6.3 percent. The data are due at 7 a.m. (1100 GMT) on Friday. The recent strong headline jobs numbers have masked\nunderlying weaknesses. Jobs have been plentiful in\nresource-rich western Canada while lay-offs have been the norm\nin the powerful central provinces of Ontario and Quebec where\nthe U.S. slowdown has taken a toll on exporters. Also, all the job growth in November came from part-time\njobs while full-time positions were lost. \"I think the risk is certainly toward a pretty weak\nnumber,\" said Marc Levesque, chief fixed-income strategist at\nTD Securities. \"The data on GDP growth for the past two months has been\nsurprisingly weak and suggests the Canadian economy in the\nfourth quarter will probably have difficulty even eking out\npositive growth,\" he said. \"I'd be surprised to see Canada's\njob market continue to pump out jobs at that pace.\" In the United States, private sector employment likely\ndeclined by 40,000 in December, suggesting an abrupt slowing of\nemployment there, the monthly ADP National Employment Report\nshowed on Wednesday. Max Clarke, economist at IDEAglobal, sees downside risks to\nthe research firm's estimate of 20,000 new jobs in December,\nbecause the data are so volatile. \"You could even see a number that's single digit,\" Clarke\nsaid. Whatever the jobs report reveals, the Bank of Canada is\nunlikely to be rattled. Bank Governor David Dodge has already\nacknowledged that fourth-quarter 2006 growth appears to be\nweaker than the bank had anticipated. The central bank has kept its key overnight rate steady at\n4.25 percent since May 2006 following seven straight hikes,\nsaying the risks to its economic outlook are balanced. Markets rule out any interest rate moves on Jan. 16, the\nbank's next policy announcement date, but are keen to see if\npolicymakers will change their neutral tone to reveal a bias\ntoward rate cuts later this year, as is widely expected. \"Whether or not (the jobs report) will cause them to revise\ntheir risks is going to depend on whatever data we get for the\nU.S. and Canada from this point on,\" said Levesque. The course of Canadian interest rates may also depend on\nwhen the U.S. Federal Reserve starts easing monetary policy,\nsome analysts said. The Canadian dollar fell hard versus the U.S. dollar on\nWednesday, in part on expectations that the Fed may hold rates\nsteady for longer than many expected.\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/canada-economy-jobs-idUSN0341821920070103", "sectors": [], "title": "update 1 - canada ' s slowing economy set to crimp jobs growth"},

The dollar jumped after the Institute for Supply Management\nsaid its manufacturing index climbed to 51.4, above the 50\nthreshold that separates expansion and contraction. The\ngreenback erased losses spurred by an earlier report showing\nthe first contraction in the U.S. private sector job market\nsince April 2003. \"The fact that ISM came back above 50 puts the whole\nsoft-landing, dollar-positive scenario back in play,\" said\nBoris Schlossberg, senior currency strategist at Forex Capital\nMarkets in New York. Led by strong gains against European currencies including\nsterling, the euro and the Swiss franc, the dollar was set for\nits biggest rise in around six months against a basket of six\nmajor currencies =USD. The euro EUR= was trading down 0.9 percent on the day at\n$1.3156, while sterling tumbled more than 1 percent to $1.9496\nGBP=. At current prices, sterling is having its biggest\none-day decline since July 2005. The dollar was up 0.7 percent at 119.62 yen JPY= after\nreaching as high as 119.68 on electronic trading platform EBS. The dollar rose around 1.2 percent against the Swiss\ncurrency, to 1.2276 francs CHF= -- on pace for the largest\nsingle-day gain since September 2005 at current prices. Analysts, however, said gains from the ISM report may not\nlast. \"I suspect follow-through dollar buying will be limited in\nthe lead-up to Friday's employment report,\" said Ron Simpson,\ndirector of currency research at Action Economics in Tampa,\nFlorida. Earlier in the session, the dollar had given up some ground\nafter a report showed employment in the U.S. private sector\ncontracted unexpectedly in December. The ADP National Employment Report showed private-sector\njobs likely declined 40,000 in the month, flying in the face of\nconsensus forecasts for a solid rise. The soft report led some traders to speculate that the more\nclosely watched nonfarm payrolls report -- due from the\ngovernment on Friday -- could also come in softer than\nexpectations. \"It points to a pretty poor payroll number on Friday,\" said\nShaun Osborne, senior currency strategist at TD Securities in\nToronto. A weak reading in that payrolls report would likely\nstrengthen the view that the Federal Reserve may start cutting\ninterest rates in coming months to shore up a slowing economy. However, in the wake of the higher-than-expected ISM\nreading, the futures market is pricing in only a 12 percent\nchance of a rate cut by March, down from 18 percent in early\ntrading. Later on Wednesday traders scour the minutes from the Fed's\nDec. 12 meeting -- the fourth straight occasion the central\nbank kept rates on hold since its last rate rise to 5.25\npercent in June. Elsewhere, the euro rose to an eight-year high against the\nSwiss franc on Wednesday, as investors continued a broad trend\nof selling low yielding currencies.\n (Additional reporting by Steven C.

The stock has languished here for some period of time,\" said Bill Schultz, chief investment officer at McQueen, Ball & Associates, a Home Depot shareholder.Home Depot, the No. 2 U.S. retailer, on Wednesday said that it was a mutual decision between the board of directors and Chairman and Chief Executive Nardelli, 58, that he leave the company. He was replaced by 57-year-old Vice Chairman Frank Blake.Nardelli, who was one of three executives in the running to succeed Jack Welch as head of General Electric Co. years ago, came to Home Depot with much fanfare in December 2000, and was credited with overhauling purchasing and technology systems, saving the company money.\"At the time, when he came in, he certainly brought the skills that the company needed, and he brought the company -- I would say -- almost to the 21st century,\" Arun Daniel, an analyst at ING Investments, said.\"He changed all the systems, created more of a centralized structure within the company (and) communications systems improved.\"But Nardelli also quickly drew mixed reviews from workers used to the more free-wheeling management style of founders Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank.Meanwhile, Home Depot came under increasing competition from rival Lowe's Cos.

The company said on Wednesday that Nardelli would receive a severance package valued at $210 million, including a $20 million cash payment, the acceleration of unvested deferred stock awards, unvested options, vested deferred shares and other compensation.Nardelli further inflamed critics by refusing to take questions or review the company's performance at its 2006 annual meeting.Meanwhile, Home Depot stock lost 8 percent between December 5, 2000, when Nardelli's appointment was announced, and the close of trading last Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.The company also faces a probe for its options dating practices and said last month that it found almost 20 years of options backdating, resulting in $200 million in unrecorded expenses.

COMMENTARY: CARY LEAHEY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK:\"I see more headlines that are bearish for bonds than are bullish, but the market could be higher because it already lost so much ground in December and there weren't any surprises in the headlines of the FOMC minutes at all.\"One bullish item for Treasuries was that several members of the Fed monetary policy committee saw a 'subdued tone' to the economic data and thought the downside risk to growth had increased.

{"date": "14:21 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "WASHINGTON Jan 3 With Democrats poised to take\nover Congress, President George W. Bush on Wednesday used a\nRose Garden ceremony and a newspaper opinion piece to try to\nsalvage his domestic agenda and win support for an Iraq policy\nhe has yet to announce. Speaking at a ceremony after a Cabinet meeting, Bush used\nthe White House stage to draw attention to his domestic agenda\nby announcing a plan to balance the U.S. budget by 2012. He\nalso wrote a rare opinion article in The Wall Street Journal\npromoting his new strategy for Iraq. Bush called upon Democrats to set aside politics, but\nDemocrats, who are preparing to flex their muscle with a\nlegislative push when they take command of Congress on\nThursday, responded cautiously. \"We hope that when the president says compromise, it means\nmore than 'do it my way,' which is what he's meant in the\npast,\" said New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer. In his White House comments, Bush said he would present a\nfive-year plan to Congress next month that would balance the\nbudget by 2012 -- three years after his presidency ends -- and\nmake lower tax rates permanent. Balancing the budget in that time frame would require\nsubstantial spending discipline, given that recent projections\nby the White House showed it expected a budget gap of $127\nbillion by 2011. In early February, Congress expects Bush to request about\n$100 billion in additional \"emergency\" funds to pay for combat\nin Iraq and Afghanistan. The wars currently are being funded\nwith $70 billion put into the pipeline a few months ago. \"We welcome the president's newfound commitment to a\nbalanced budget, but his comments make us wary,\" said incoming\nHouse Budget Committee Chairman John Spratt of South Carolina.\n\"They suggest that his budget will still embody the policies\nthat led to the largest deficits in history.\" Bush also wrote in a rare opinion article in The Wall\nStreet Journal on Wednesday that his new strategy for Iraq\nwould help the \"people gain control of the security situation\nand hasten the day when the Iraqi government gains full control\nover its affairs.\" \"We now have the opportunity to build a bipartisan\nconsensus to fight and win the war,\" he wrote. NEW IRAQ STRATEGY Bush is to announce a new strategy for Iraq as early as\nTuesday and he is considering a short-term increase of\nthousands of U.S. troops to try to bring stability to Baghdad. The White House described him as \"narrowing the choices\"\nand said he was focusing on a package of options that included\n\"the military front, the economic front and the political\nfront\" to announce as a whole. Bush has two years left in office and believes he can\naccomplish some of his legislative agenda, even though his\nRepublican Party has lost control of the House of\nRepresentatives and the Senate and Americans are increasingly\nturning their attention to the 2008 race to succeed him.\n (Additional reporting by Glenn Somerville and Richard Cowan)\n\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/bush-cabinet-idUSN0341188220070103", "sectors": [["Bonds"]], "title": "bush seeks backing for agenda on u . s . budget , iraq"},

The rate of increase in real GDP was expected\nto pick up gradually as the drag from the contraction in\nresidential construction diminished, returning towards the end\nof 2007 to a rate close to the staff's estimate of potential\noutput growth. Core inflation was anticipated to edge down in\n2007 and 2008 in response to a waning of the effects of higher\nenergy and import prices, a step-down in rent increases, and\nthe emergence of a small amount of slack in the economy.\" OCT. 24-25 FOMC: Minutes released on Nov. 15 \"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated\nthat growth of real GDP had slowed further in the third\nquarter, reflecting both a significant drag from the continuing\ncontraction in residential construction and a steep decline in\nmotor vehicle assemblies. Looking ahead, a gradual reduction in\nthe restraining effects of the contraction in residential\ninvestment and further solid gains in consumer and business\nspending were expected to lead to a pickup in GDP growth\nthrough 2007 and into 2008. These gains in spending were likely\nto be supported by past declines in energy prices and continued\ngains in payroll employment and labor income. Real GDP was\nexpected to rise at a somewhat slower rate over the next two\nyears than in 2006 in part as a result of less impetus from\nhousehold wealth, interest rates, and fiscal policy. The\nprojected increase in real output over the next year or so was\na little below the staff's estimate of potential output growth,\nleading to a lessening in pressures on resource utilization.\nCore inflation was anticipated to edge down in 2007 and 2008\nrelative to the second half of this year because of the\ndiminishing impetus from the prices of energy and other\ncommodities and because of the modest easing in resource\nutilization.\" SEPT. 20 FOMC: Minutes released on Oct. 11 \"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated\nthat real GDP growth would continue to slow into the second\nhalf of 2006 before strengthening gradually thereafter. By\n2008, output was projected to be expanding at a pace about\nequal to the staff's forecast of potential output growth. The\nstaff, however, had again reduced its projection for potential\nGDP growth, and the projected slow pace of growth over the next\nseveral quarters was thus consistent with an opening of only a\nsmall gap in resource utilization. In the near term, the\ncooling of the housing market and lower motor vehicle\nproduction were expected to hold growth back. At the same time,\nthough, significantly lower energy prices, sustained increases\nin labor income, and favorable labor market conditions were\nanticipated to support expansion through the end of the year.\nFurther ahead, the lagged effects of the previous tightening of\nmonetary policy and waning stimulus from household wealth and\nfiscal policy were anticipated to restrain growth, but the drag\nfrom the downturn in residential construction was expected to\nabate. Core consumer price inflation was projected to drop back\nsomewhat later this year and next, reflecting the emergence of\nslack in the economy and lower energy costs.\" AUG. 8 FOMC; Minutes released on Aug. 29 \"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated\nthat real GDP growth would slow in the second half of 2006 and\n2007, and to a lower rate than had been anticipated in the\nprior forecast. The marking down of the outlook was largely\nattributable to the annual revision of the national income and\nproduct accounts, which involved downward revisions to actual\nGDP growth in prior years and prompted reductions in the\nstaff's estimate of potential output. The slowdown in the\nhousing market, the effects of higher energy prices on\nhousehold purchasing power, the waning impetus of household\nwealth effects on consumer spending, and the effects of past\npolicy tightening were expected to hold economic growth below\npotential over the next six quarters. Core consumer price\ninflation was projected to drop back somewhat later this year\nand next, mainly as the effects of higher energy and import\nprices abated.\" JUNE 28-29 FOMC; Minutes released on July 20 \"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated\nthat, after the significant deceleration of real GDP in the\ncurrent quarter from the first quarter of 2006, growth would\nproceed through the end of 2007 at a pace a bit below the rate\nof growth of the economy's potential. The outlook for modest\ngrowth of real GDP reflected a slowdown in the housing market,\nthe effects of past policy tightening, and a diminished boost\nto consumer spending from increases in household wealth. Core\nconsumer price inflation was projected to have stepped up in\nthe second quarter from its average pace over the preceding\nseveral quarters but to then drop back somewhat, albeit to a\nlevel higher than previously forecasted, as energy and import\nprices flatten out and some slack emerges in labor and product\nmarkets.\" MAY 10 FOMC; Minutes released on May 31 \"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting showed real\nGDP growth moderating somewhat from the average pace of the\nprevious several quarters. The projected deceleration of real\nGDP reflected the lagged effects of the tightening of monetary\npolicy, the waning impetus from increases in household wealth,\nand reduced stimulus from fiscal policy. While higher energy\nprices were expected to boost inflation in the near term,\nstructural productivity was strong, and the influence of higher\nenergy and material costs was thought likely to moderate. Thus,\nconsumer prices, after increasing at a faster rate in the first\nhalf of the year, were expected to decelerate later this year\nand next year.\" MARCH 27-28 FOMC; Minutes released on April 18 \"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting showed real\nGDP expanding briskly in the current quarter.

Core PCE inflation was\nexpected to be a touch higher this year than in 2005, largely\nbecause of the pass-through of higher energy and nonfuel import\nprices, but, with energy prices leveling out, core inflation\nwas projected to drop back modestly in 2007.\"\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/economy-fed-forecasts-idUSFED20070103", "sectors": [], "title": "factbox - fed staff forecasts from fomc minutes"},

{"date": "14:29 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "NEW YORK Jan 3 The price of copper tumbled to\na near 9-month low in futures trade on Wednesday after a hefty\ninflux of visible London warehouse supplies fueled speculation\nof a supply glut hitting the market this year, analysts said. At the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division,\ncopper for March delivery HGH7 ended down 22.20 cents, or 7.7\npercent, at $2.6490 a lb, after dealing between $2.6450 and\n$2.7980. The $2.6450 low was the cheapest March copper has been\nsince April 12, 2006. Spot January HGF7 fell 22.15 cents at $2.6325, a shade\nabove its session trough at $2.6320. Final estimated copper volumes reached 14,000 lots. Since topping out at $4.16 a lb in early May of last year,\nCOMEX copper prices have erased more than 36 percent of their\nvalue. But, traders were quick to point out that prices were\nstill up a respectable 33 percent year over year. \"I think the market had already made a pretty substantial\nmove to the upside, that was overdone, and now we are\ncorrecting it to an extent,\" said one COMEX floor dealer. Inventory data on Tuesday showed copper stocks at LME\nwarehouses surged 7,775 tonnes. An additional 1,975 tonnes were\nreported overnight on Wednesday, bringing total stocks to\n192,550 tonnes -- their highest since March 2004. \"Stocks were up again today, and we are in sight of the\nsignificant 200,000 a tonne mark on the London Metal Exchange,\nwith this, no doubt, being the prime catalyst behind the change\nin psychology,\" said Edward Meir, metals analyst with Man\nFinancial. The almost daily increases in copper warehouse stocks were\nseen as a direct reflection of the market's falling demand\ngrowth, analysts said. \"The stocks keep building. It seems like the supply\nproblems have been pretty much resolved, leading to greater\navailability, and I think people are intent upon liquidating\nany excess inventory and moving to more of a hand-to-mouth\nfashion ... that is helping to contribute to the pressure on\ncopper values,\" said Steve Platt, an analyst with Archer\nFinancials in Chicago. Higher inventory levels, softer demand in the U.S. and\nChina and receding threats of supply disruptions from Chile\nwere all seen contributing to the market's bearish tone. Chinese consumption of refined copper is expected to fall 7\npercent this year as higher copper prices were seen dampening\ndemand. Meanwhile, Codelco, the world's largest copper producer,\nsaid on Tuesday it had sold 80 percent of its allocated 1.5\nmillion tonnes of refined copper in 2007, and will sell the\nremaining 20 percent on the spot market.[nN02331044] On the economic front, a survey showing the U.S. factory\nsector expanded in December did little to sway the broad-based\nselling Wednesday. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of\nnational factory activity climbed to 51.4 from 49.5 in November\n-- above the 50 threshold that separates growth from\ncontraction. On the LME, three-months copper MCU3 sank to a session\nlow at $5,822 a tonne, a level last seen on April 7, before\nsettling at $5,855, down $255 or 4.2 percent from Tuesday's\nkerb close.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/markets-copper-comex-idUSN0351875420070103", "sectors": [], "title": "us copper futures sink 7 pct on inventory builds"},
{"date": "14:48 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " (Adds Fed minutes and economist comment, updates prices) By Chris ReeseNEW YORK Jan 3 (Reuters) - U.S. government bond prices\nrose slightly on Wednesday after minutes from the Federal\nReserve's last policy meeting revealed central bank members saw\nincreased downside risks to economic growth. That concern over potentially slower growth helped to\nmarginally boost investor expectations that the Fed may be\nconsidering the possibility of an official interest rate cut\nlater this year. \"One bullish item for Treasuries was that several members\nof the Fed monetary policy committee saw a 'subdued tone' to\nthe economic data and thought the downside risk to growth had\nincreased,\" said Cary Leahey, managing director at Decision\nEconomics in New York. Leahy cautioned however that a good portion of the\nindicators released since the Dec. 12 Fed policy meeting have\nshown an economy that is looking relatively resilient, and the\ncentral bank's concern over slowing growth was based on\nrelatively old data. \"The one headline that could be viewed as bullish for bonds\nis probably, correctly, considered by the market to be out of\ndate,\" Leahy said. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR were trading 1/32\nhigher in price for a yield of 4.68 percent. Early in the day, Treasuries rallied after a surprise\ncontraction in a private jobs report hinted the nonfarm\npayrolls report on Friday could prove soft. After the data,\neconomists at some Wall Street banks cut their forecasts for\nthe government's nonfarm payrolls report. Data showed that U.S. private sector employment likely\ndeclined by 40,000 in December, the first contraction since\nApril 2003, according to the ADP National Employment Report. \"Clearly, going into the employment data this Friday,\npeople coming into the New Year with a clean book would\ncertainly feel that this (the ADP report) is something people\nwant to be buying bonds on,\" said Michael Cheah, vice president\nand portfolio manager with AIG SunAmerica Asset Management in\nJersey City, New Jersey. However, those early bond gains were later tempered by a\nstronger-than-expected U.S. factory index. The Institute for\nSupply Management's December manufacturing report reading was\n51.4, above the 50 mark that divides expansion from\ncontraction. Economists had forecast the index would rise to\n49.9 from November's 49.5 reading.

{"date": "14:58 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " (Recasts with AMF statement, closing share prices) By William Emmanuel and Marie MaitrePARIS Jan 3 (Reuters) - The French financial markets\nwatchdog AMF said on Wednesday it would decide on Jan. 9 on a\ntarget date by which French billionaire Francois Pinault must\nmake a bid for Suez LYOE.PA or else abstain for six months. A bid could derail a government-orchestrated plan for an\n80-billion-euro ($106.2 billion) merger between Suez, a water\nand energy group, and state-controlled Gaz de France GAZ.PA.\nThe shot-gun marriage was arranged last February in the face of\nunwelcome advances toward Suez by Italy's Enel (ENEI.MI), but\nlegal rulings have delayed the consummation until next July. After a meeting on Wednesday, the AMF decided that due to a\nstatement by the Pinault family holding company Artemis on\nTuesday that it was keeping all its options open regarding a\npossible bid for Suez, Artemis had to make its intentions\nclear. Unless Artemis makes a statement before next Tuesday that\nit has no plans for a bid, the AMF's ruling council will\nconsult with all parties involved and fix \"a date at which the\ncompany Artemis, alone or in concert, needs to register a\nplanned public offer for the shares of Suez or issue a\nstatement that contains the characteristics of a public offer,\"\nAMF said in a statement. Artemis and Suez were not immediately available for\ncomment. Earlier on Wednesday, the government reiterated its backing\nfor a merger between Suez and Gaz de France. \"The position of the state as a shareholder is as follows:\nThe state supports clearly and strongly the Suez-GDF merger\nplan,\" government spokesman Jean-Francois Cope told reporters\nafter the weekly meeting of the French government. The Suez-GDF merger already hangs in the balance after a\nrecent court decision that it cannot go ahead until the full\nliberalisation of European Union energy markets on July 1 --\npotentially tying its fate to the outcome of April/May\npresidential elections. Suez shares closed down 0.33 percent at 39.77 euros. The\nstock surged nearly 6 percent in the past two sessions to hit a\nlifetime high of 40.50 euros. Suez is the world's\nsecond-largest water group and a major energy company. ALBERT FRERE SEEN KEY French media reports said Pinault plans to break up Suez if\nhis bid succeeds, selling its energy assets to GDF and its\nenvironmental unit to Veolia Environnement (VIE.PA). Wendel Investissement (MWDP.PA) and concessions group Vinci\n(SGEF.PA) could also be interested in buying parts of Suez,\naccording to the reports. But doubts remained on Pinault's ability to wrap up the\nfinancing for a costly acquisition, which some analysts\nestimated at around 60 billion euros. \"If Pinault goes to see banks saying he has a commitment\nfrom GDF to buy Suez's energy business for 40 billion euros,\nand from Veolia to take the environmental unit for 10 billion,\nhe will have no problem raising the cash,\" said a sector\nanalyst, who asked not to be named. \"But maybe nothing is agreed yet and this is why Suez is\ntrying to force him (Pinault) into the open,\" the analyst\nadded. Pinault may also have problems convincing some shareholders\nto tender their shares, a banker close to the situation said,\npointing in particular to Albert Frere, who owns around 8\npercent of Suez's capital and 12 percent of the voting rights. \"Albert Frere would not say no to a hefty capital gain, but\nI doubt he will feel like making a present to Pinault,\" the\nbanker said. Frere could opt to launch his own breakup bid for Suez, the\nbanker said, a scenario which some analysts believe is\npossible, given recent delays in the completion of the Suez-GDF\nmerger.

The losses dragged down other base metals and weighed on\nLondon-listed miners such as Xstrata XTA.L, Vedanta (VED.L)\nand Antofagasta (ANTO.L), which were down more than 5 percent. Copper for delivery in three months MCU3 on the London\nMetal Exchange (LME) hit $5,822 a tonne, a level last seen on\nApril 7, before ending at $5,855, down 4.2 percent from\nTuesday's $6,110 close. At the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division,\ncopper for March delivery HGH7 ended down 22.20 cents, or 7.7\npercent, at $2.6490 a lb, its cheapest price since April 12. Since topping out at $4.16 a lb in early May of last year,\nCOMEX copper prices have erased more than 36 percent of their\nvalue, but were still up a respectable 33 percent year over\nyear. LME Lead MPB3 bucked the downtrend and rose by $68, or\n4.1 percent, to $1,720, near its record high of $1,785. \"It is all a bit unstable at the moment ... some are\nclosing close to their highs so maybe we have seen the worst of\nthe sell-off,\" an LME trader said. Copper has lost more than 30 percent since hitting a record\nhigh of $8,800 in May and more than 25 percent since early\nSeptember on growing worries about falling demand as global\neconomic growth slows. Forecasts of a copper surplus this year then accelerated\nlosses. \"Clearly the increase in inventories has got people\nworried. We're (forecasting) a surplus of about 250,000 tonnes\nthis year,\" Jim Lennon, analyst at Macquarie Bank, said. \"People are saying it's all over as far as copper is\nconcerned and clearly it is. Our price forecast this year is\n$2.60 a pound.\" That would work out to an average around $5,730 this year. DEBATE Stocks of copper at LME warehouses have risen to more than\n190,000 tonnes from little more than 25,000 in July 2005. On Tuesday, copper stocks jumped 7,775 tonnes and on\nWednesday the rise was 1,975. \"It's possible copper could hit $5,000 during the course of\nthis month, although you might see some hesitation at around\n$5,500,\" a trader said. Expectations were, however, that copper might bounce before\nresuming its downtrend, but the debate over how much further it\nwould fall was still raging, analysts said. Lately, fears of a sluggish U.S. housing sector have\ndampened sentiment in the markets. But a better-than-expected December reading on the U.S.\nmanufacturing sector from the Institute for Supply Management\ncould be a sign of the U.S. macroeconomic trend becoming more\nsupportive, a Barclays Capital report said. \"We do not see much evidence that weakness in the U.S.\nconstruction sector is having significant spillover into\nmanufacturing activity,\" the report said. The bank expected a bottoming out for the residential\nhousing sector to emerge earlier than others believed. Some market participants said recovery would take a while\nbecause copper had been overvalued for some time now. \"It went up too high,\" said London-based Ian Morley, chief\nexecutive at fund management company Dawnay Day Brokers. \"The\nfundamentals are good in the long term, but they are not that\ngood in the short term and the rises were driven by liquidity,\n(commodity) index and fund management flows.\" Aluminium MAL3 fell 1.7 percent to $2,740 against\nTuesday's close of $2,787, whilst zinc MZN3 saw a late\nrecovery and was quoted at $4,149/4,150 versus $4,130 in the\nprevious session.

Globe and Mail newspaper said on Wednesday that only one\naircraft, the Spartan C-27J, was considered a \"viable bidder\"\nfor the contract, which the newspaper pegged at C$3 billion\n($2.6 billion), including 20 years of maintenance. It reported long-standing complaints by rival EADS-CASA,\nthe Spanish unit of Airbus parent EADS EAD.PA EAD.MC, that\nthe requirements laid out by the military effectively excluded\nEADS-CASA's C-295s. But Canadian Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. John Blakeley\nsaid the military and the government had not finalized\nrequirements for the planes, which will replace a combination\nof Buffalo and Hercules planes. \"The project is still progressing toward departmental and\ngovernmental approval,\" he told Reuters. In theory, that means the C-295s still can compete with the\nC-27J, made principally by a subsidiary of Italy's Finmeccanica\nSpA (SIFI.MI). The potential Canadian project would be done\njointly with a division of L-3 Communications Holdings Inc.\n(LLL.N) and with Rolls-Royce Plc (RR.L). EADS-CASA has for years complained that Canada is looking\nfor a plane faster than its C-295. Blakeley said he could not\ncomment on specific requirements but said that Canada was so\nvast and cold it did need to fly to accident sites quickly if\nit wanted to rescue survivors rather than dead victims. \"There's no question that Canada has a unique requirement\nwhen it comes to search and rescue,\" he said. Canada's previous Liberal government in 2004 earmarked\nC$1.3 billion for search-and-rescue planes but no contract was\nsigned. Last year Canada said Boeing Co.

Top U.S. oil companies Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) and\nChevron Corp. (CVX.N) fell about 3.4 percent and ConocoPhillips\n(COP.N) fell 4.6 percent in afternoon trading on the New York\nStock Exchange. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange's oil services index .OSX\nwas down about 4.6 percent as low oil prices and a profit\nwarning by index member Nabors Industries Ltd.

U.S. crude oil prices fell $2.76 to $58.29 a barrel. Natural gas prices have dropped 30 percent since late\nNovember on the mild winter demand and high inventory levels.\nGas slipped another 13 cents on Wednesday to $6.17 per million\nBritish thermal units. \"What is keeping natural gas prices from total collapse is\nbasically the higher oil price,\" said Gheit. If oil prices fall\nto $50 a barrel, gas prices could plummet to around $4 per\nmillion Btu, he said. Leading oil service companies Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB.N) and\nHalliburton Co. (HAL.N) were off 3.9 and 4.1 percent,\nrespectively, while Weatherford International (WFT.N) and W-H\nEnergy Services WHQ.N dropped around 8 percent. Analyst Mark Urness of Calyon Securities said, \"Unless we\nget cold weather pretty soon, gas prices are going to go lower.\n...

The sentiment has turned very negative,\" he added. A warm winter could also have near-term implications on\nexploration and production companies with a large gas exposure,\nincluding XTO Energy Inc.

N.TO shareholders\nvoted on Wednesday to seal the takeover by Brazil's Companhia\nVale do Rio Doce (VALE5.SA) (RIO.N), the final step in taking a\nmining sector icon out of Canadian hands. CVRD, the biggest iron ore producer in the world, took\ncontrol of Inco in October and up until this morning held 87.8\npercent of Inco's outstanding shares. Inco had called a meeting for shareholders to consider a\ntransaction by way of amalgamation, a legal procedure so that\nCVRD could take up 100 percent of the nickel producer. The motion to amalgamate passed unceremoniously at a\nspecial meeting in Toronto with about three dozen shareholders\npresent. Inco shares will stop trading on the TSX within the next\nfew days. Its stock stopped trading on the New York Stock\nExchange in November. Remaining shareholders will receive C$86 for every share\nheld. The total value of the deal is worth C$19.35 billion. Shares of Inco were up 6 Canadian cents at C$85.96 on\nWednesday on the TSX on volume of about 80,000 shares by early\nafternoon. At the meeting, where Inco's name was displayed by itself\nfor the last time, one shareholder asked former Inco CEO and\ncurrent CVRD-Inco's chief executive, Scott Hand, to translate\nCompanhia Vale do Rio Doce to English from Portuguese. It\nmeans: Company of the valley of the sweet river. Another investor spoke about how three generations of\nfamily members owned Inco stock. INCO NAME LIVES ON For Hand, who failed to create a made-in-Canada mining\npowerhouse by merging Inco with former compatriot Falconbridge,\nat least the 'Inco' name will live on. \"The new company is called CVRD Inco Limited, so the Inco\nname continues as a great name and I think that was one of the\nsmart things that CVRD decided in acquiring Inco --  to keep\nthe Inco name,\" Hand told a reporter after the meeting. \"We consider marketing to be very important and so does\nCVRD and I think that lots of places around the world...Inco\nnickel is seen as something that is pretty good.\" Inco was known as the world's No. 2 nickel producer and\nCVRD is set to become the largest producer of the metal when\nnew nickel projects come on stream over the next few years. Hand lost Falconbridge to a sweeter offer from Swiss-based\nXstrata Plc XTA.L in July 2006. After shopping around for\nother buyers, Inco agreed to be taken over by CVRD in\nSeptember. CVRD chief executive Roger Agnelli appointed Hand as the\nhead of CVRD Inco, in charge of all nickel operations. Since\nthen, the two companies have been integrating assets and Hand\nsaid it is \"going well.\" \"I think everything will be completed probably by the end\nof this month or early in February. Everything is on schedule,\"\nhe said. Hand will be with the company until integration is\ncomplete. After that, Hand and Agnelli will discuss Hand's next\nrole. Meanwhile, CVRD and Xstrata have started general talks\nabout combining operations in the Sudbury, Ontario basin, where\nCVRD Inco and Xstrata Nickel (formerly Falconbridge) have major\nnickel operations. \"You can assume during the new year that (discussions) will\nproceed,\" said Hand. When Inco and Falconbridge were trying to merge, the two\ncompanies touted millions of dollars in synergies from\ncombining their operations in Sudbury. \"Today it's two separate companies talking instead of one.\nIt takes discussions, it takes time, it takes work.

{"date": "15:35 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " (Adds Fed minutes, updates market reaction) By Lucia MutikaniNEW YORK Jan 3 (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing rebounded in\nDecember after a contraction in November, while construction\nspending fell less than expected in November, according to data\non Wednesday suggesting a moderate economic expansion. However, the data was eclipsed by minutes from the Federal\nReserve's Dec. 12 policy meeting, which showed some members\nwere becoming a bit anxious about the economy and a separate report saying private-sector employment fell in December --\nthe first time in three years. The Fed minutes released on Wednesday said that while\ninflation was the predominant concern, some members felt the\n\"subdued tone\" of economic data meant risks to growth had\nincreased. \"Several members judged that the subdued tone of some\nincoming indicators meant that the downside risks to economic\ngrowth in the near term had increased a little and become a bit\nmore broadly based than previously thought,\" said the minutes. Government bond prices edged higher, while the dollar\ninitially fell on the minutes. Stocks dipped after the minutes\nwere released. But analysts said little weight should be attached to the\nminutes as they had been overtaken by recent data pointing to a\nresilient economy. \"This Fed meeting was held before the spate of reports,\nstarting with retail sales in the middle of December, that\nshowed the economy looking more resilient,\" said Cary Leahey,\nmanaging director at Decision Economics in New York. Earlier, the Institute for Supply Management said its index\nof national factory activity climbed to 51.4 from 49.5 in\nNovember -- above the 50-threshold that separates growth from\ncontraction. Analysts had forecast a reading of 49.9. \"That makes the general economy look steadier and even\nfirmer than it was thought to be,\" said Pierre Ellis, senior\neconomist at Decision Economics in New York. INFLATION PRESSURES MODERATING Analysts were also encouraged by the decline in the ISM's\nprices paid index, which measures inflation pressures at the\nindustrial level. The index fell to 47.5 from 53.5, while a\nmeasure of new orders climbed to 52.1 from 48.7. \"The fact the price index is down is good news,\" said\nRobert MacIntosh, chief economist at Eaton Vance Management in\nBoston. However, for the Fed the overall index is \"a small\npiece of data but everything else being equal, this would make\nthem hold off from a cut.\" The data was seen as further confirmation that the Fed\nwould probably hold interest rates unchanged well into the\nfirst half of 2007. The central bank raised its target for the federal funds\nrate 17 times to 5.25 percent between June 2004 and June 2006.\nAnalysts expect it to start easing monetary policy sometime\nthis year. The next policy-setting meeting for the Fed is\nscheduled for the end of the month. A major component of factory output appeared to stabilize\nin December according to sales figures on Wednesday. Paul\nBallew, General Motor's chief sales analyst said the industry's\nU.S. light vehicle sales in December ran at an annual adjusted\nrate of 16.9 million, while sales for 2006 are estimated down\nabout 2.3 percent to 16.7 million. Construction spending also pointed to a resilient economy.\nSpending fell 0.2 percent in November, led by an eighth\nstraight drop in private residential building that more than\noffset record highs in nonresidential and public construction. HOUSING MARKET RESLIENT More current data showed some resilience in the U.S.\nhousing market. Mortgage applications rose last week, led by\ndemand for home purchase loans even as interest rates climbed\nfor a fourth consecutive week, an industry trade group said. The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally\nadjusted index of mortgage application activity, which includes\nboth refinance and purchase loans, rose 3.6 percent last week. But analysts were cautious on the economy and pointed to a\nreport that showed U.S. private sector employment contracted in\nDecember for the first time since April 2003. The monthly ADP National Employment Report showed private\nsector employers shed 40,000 jobs after adding 158,000 jobs in\nNovember. The report is based on payroll data and measures the\nchange in total private sector nonfarm employment each month. \"The ADP number suggests we are only starting to feel the\nimpact of a slower economy,\" said Boris Schlossberg, senior\ncurrency strategist at Forex Capital Markets in New York. The ADP report hinted the government's closely watched\nnonfarm payrolls report for December, due on Friday, might\nprove soft, although economists debate the extent of the\ncorrelation between the two reports. \"This is a big surprise. ... There is no evidence of\nsystematic problems in the ADP survey,\" said Ian Shepherdson,\nchief U.S. economist at High Frequency economics in New York. He said his firm would cut its estimate for the Labor\nDepartment's report to 75,000 jobs created, from an original\nestimate of 100,000. \"ADP is not perfect and is sometimes horribly wrong, but it\nis the best of a bad bunch of payroll indicators and cannot be\ncompletely ignored.\" According to the latest Reuters poll, Economists expect\nFriday's report show 110,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added in\nDecember, slowing from a 132,000 gain in November.\n\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/usa-economy-idUSN0339147520070103", "sectors": [["Bonds"]], "title": "wrapup 2 - u . s . factories rebound , fed cites growth concerns"},

{"date": "15:08 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " (Adds comments, details throughout, byline) By Jonathan StempelNEW YORK Jan 3 (Reuters) - A former Morgan Stanley (MS.N)\nregional director in wealth management sued the Wall Street\ninvestment bank on Wednesday, saying he was fired because of\nhis age. Edward Sullivan, 56, who had been a managing director,\naccused human resources executives Jeffrey Brodsky and Eric\nKayne of conspiring to end his employment, in part to make room\nfor a friend of Brodsky's who lacked an assignment. Sullivan said the executives interfered with his 2005\nannual review, even preparing a \"made-up, poison-pen critique\"\nof his work to advance their cause. The Darien, Connecticut, resident said their actions helped\nlead to his May 13, 2006 dismissal, 10 days before his 56th\nbirthday. Brodsky \"marked the aging Mr. Sullivan for termination,\"\nand enlisted Kayne's help, according to the complaint. \"He\n(Brodsky) wanted Sullivan terminated even though there was no\nreason to terminate him, and he wanted it done now, before\nSullivan got any older.\" Jim Wiggins, a Morgan Stanley spokesman, said: \"The lawsuit\nhas absolutely no merit, and we will contest it vigorously.\" He\nsaid Brodsky and Kayne still work for Morgan Stanley and were\nnot available for comment. \"Morgan Stanley holds itself out as subscribing to a\nculture of excellence and management transparency. Our client\nalleges that those promises were not honored,\" said John\nCrossman, a partner at Zukerman Gore & Brandeis LLP who\nrepresents Sullivan. \"He was a 25-year veteran, well-respected,\nfrequently commended, and all of that has been taken away.\" Sullivan sued Morgan Stanley and the executives in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York. He is\nasking for his job back with seniority and benefits, and at\nleast $30 million of compensatory and punitive damages. The plaintiff was one of six regional directors who lost\nthat title last March when James Gorman, who runs Morgan\nStanley's global wealth management unit, streamlined the\nbusiness's management structure. Gorman halved the number of regional directors to four. He\nkept two of the existing directors and hired two others from\nMerrill Lynch & Co. MER.N, his former employer. Sullivan had worked for Morgan Stanley or its predecessors\nsince 1981, according to the complaint. He rose to managing\ndirector in 1999 and was paid between $800,000 and $1 million\nannually from 2001 to 2005, the complaint said. Wall Street investment banks regularly face bias lawsuits.\nIn 2004, Morgan Stanley agreed to pay $54 million to settle\nbias charges filed on behalf of hundreds of women who claimed\nthey were denied raises and promotions and subjected to lewd\nbehavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/morganstanley-discrimination-idUSN0341619320070103", "sectors": [], "title": "update 1 - morgan stanley sued by former exec for age bias"},
{"date": "15:46 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "WASHINGTON Energy giant ExxonMobil borrowed tactics from the tobacco industry to raise doubt about climate change, spending $16 million on groups that question global warming, a science watchdog group said on Wednesday.\"ExxonMobil has manufactured uncertainty about the human causes of global warming just as tobacco companies denied their product caused lung cancer,\" Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists said at a telephone news conference releasing the report.An ExxonMobil spokesman did not respond immediately to calls for comment.The union, a nonprofit group based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said ExxonMobil, the world's biggest publicly traded corporation, had succeeded in parlaying a relatively modest investment into unwarranted public doubt on findings that have been overwhelmingly endorsed by mainstream science.ExxonMobil did this by using the same methods used for decades by the U.S. tobacco industry, the report said, including:-- raising doubts about even the most undisputed science;-- funding a variety of front organizations to create the appearance of a broad platform;-- recruiting a number of vocal climate change contrarians;-- portraying its opposition to action as a quest for \"sound science\" rather than business self-interest;-- using its access to the Bush administration to shape federal communications and policies on global warming.TOBACCO TACTICSU.S. tobacco companies used these tactics for decades to hide the hazards of smoking, and were found liable in federal court last year for violating racketeering laws.Global warming has been blamed for stronger hurricanes, more wildfires and worse droughts. While there have been cycles of warming and cooling throughout Earth's history, the last 30 years have seen a steep warming trend which most scientists say is due to emission of so-called greenhouse gases by the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles, factories and power plants.ExxonMobil has funded legitimate scientific studies on climate change, the watchdog report said, but noted it has also spent approximately $16 million between 1998 and 2005 on 43 organizations that have cast doubt on the reality of human-caused global warming.The report said these have ranged from $30,000 for the group Africa Fighting Malaria, which argues on its Web site against urgent action on climate change, to $1.6 million to the American Enterprise Institute, a pro-business think tank in Washington.James McCarthy, professor of biological oceanography and director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University, noted a 2005 statement issued by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and 10 science academies from other countries, affirming that \"climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action.\"\"This report reveals for the first time the degree to which efforts to exaggerate uncertainty in climate science produce non scientific reports designed to cast doubt on published scientific climate studies have been orchestrated by ExxonMobil,\" McCarthy said at the news conference.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-environment-exxonmobil-idUSN0341645120070103", "sectors": [], "title": "exxonmobil cultivates global warming doubt : report"},

Others sprinkled it on their dry clothes.\"It was a long-cherished desire to take a dip here during the Kumbh Mela,\" said Naba Kumar Ghosh, a young school teacher from the eastern Indian state of West Bengal. \"The experience has been one of fulfillment, a complete cleansing of the inner self.\"\"ONE WITH GOD\"Shakuntala, a 70-year-old woman who gave only one name, said she traveled all night from the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh to bathe in the Ganges, just as she has done at every Kumbh Mela over the last 25 years.\"It was a divine experience, a dip in the holy waters is like being with God,\" she said. \"God willing, I will be here for the next 'Kumbh' too\".Rama Devi, an old woman from Allahabad who could not remember her age, has not missed a single Kumbh and was determined to make it this time despite her inability to walk.With roads closed to traffic, her 35-year-old son, a soldier in the Indian army, carried her on his back for the 10-km (6-mile) walk from their house to the waters.Allahabad, in the Hindi heartland state of Uttar Pradesh, is one of four spots where Garuda, the winged steed of Hindu god Vishnu, is said to have rested during a titanic battle with demons over a pitcher of divine nectar of immortality.Garuda's flight lasted 12 divine days, or 12 years of mortal time, hence the celebration of \"Maha Kumbh Mela\" every 12 years.The midway point between two such celebrations is also considered highly favourable because the position of the sun and the moon are the same as during the \"Maha Kumbh\".The \"Maha Kumbh Mela\" in 1989 attracted 15 million pilgrims and the Guinness Book of Records dubbed it the largest gathering of human beings for a single purpose. The festival in 2001 drew between 50 and 70 million.Thousands of tents and camps have been built to house pilgrims across the 4,000 acre festival area and more than 10,000 policemen, including specially-trained \"terrorist spotters\", have been deployed, authorities said.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-india-hindu-bath-idUSDEL23313620070103", "sectors": [["World"]], "title": "hindus throng the ganges for holy bathing festival"},

A slower growth environment is nonconducive to higher commodity prices,\" said Jason Schenker, economist for Wachovia Bank,Warm weather in the United States, especially in the giant Northeast heating oil market, has also dragged down oil prices since late December.DTN Meteorlogix predicted temperatures in the U.S. Northeast would be up to 16 degrees Fahrenheit (8 Celsius) above normal this week. Other forecasters also saw warmer-than-average temperatures until next week.The National Weather Service said on Tuesday demand for heating oil in the week to January 6 would be about 33 percent below normal. Lower than normal heating oil demand is helping to offset any impact from supply cuts being implemented by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.The group has said it will reduce output by a further 500,000 barrels per day from February 1, adding to a 1.2 million bpd cut from November 1.But Nigeria's top oil official, Edmund Daukoru, told Reuters he expected OPEC supply cuts would balance the market and said that Nigeria planned to comply fully with its share of the output reduction.

{"date": "15:35 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " (Recasts lead, adds background in paragraph 10) By Rachel SandersonLONDON Jan 3 (Reuters) - Online retailers look set to be\ncrowned among the victors of Britain's Christmas trading war\nthis year alongside an uneven showing on the high street. Internet sales in Britain for the first time peaked during\nthe start of seasonal discounting last week after surging more\nthan 50 percent in the run up to Christmas, online retail\ntracker IMRG reported. It was the opposite story for Britain's high street with\nthe number of Britons visiting stores down 6.8 percent in the\nweek after Christmas, according to data from FootFall on\nWednesday. \"This has definitely been an online Christmas,\" James\nRoper, chief executive of the Interactive Media in Retail Group\n(IMRG) said. \"We think 25 million people now shop on the\nInternet.\" Roper said early evidence showed online Christmas sales are\nlooking to be around half a billion pounds better than already\nstrong industry forecasts, and will top 7.5 billion pounds ($15\nbillion) in the 10 weeks leading up to the holiday. More surprisingly, Roper said data from IMRG and eDigital\nResearch showed that unlike in previous years, there was no\nsign of a post-Christmas fall in online demand. Instead, visits to the online stores of leading British\nretailers on Dec. 27 -- the start of the holiday discounting\nseason -- spiked 30 percent higher than any previous peak. \"The young Internet shopping industry is already a huge\nsuccess, with potential to continue to grow at 40 percent per\nannum for the foreseeable future,\" Roper said. INTERNET ADVANTAGE Early reports suggest British retailers made an uneven\nshowing during crucial Christmas trading while many consumers\nstruggled with soaring household bills, higher borrowing costs\nand tame wage growth. Premium grocers, luxury goods stores as well as Britain's\nbiggest retailer Tesco (TSCO.L) are expected to have performed\nstrongly while middle market store owners have struggled. However, there are indications a strong Internet strategy\nwill have helped to separate winners from the losers. Tesco, the world's fifth largest retailer, which forecast a\n\"good Christmas,\" saw visitors to Tesco.com swell to 1.3\nmillion over the holiday period. PC World and Curry's are\nexpected to benefit from parent company DSG International's\nDSGI.L early push into online selling. Analysts predict the Christmas fortunes of clothing\nretailer Next (NXT.L), which reports on Thursday, rest on the\nsuccess of its home and online shopping Directory business. \"Part of the reason why high street retailers are having a\ntough time is due to the inexorable rise of home shopping via\nthe Internet,\" Investec Securities analyst Mark Charnock wrote\nin a note last month. Among those hardest hit are some middle market retailers\nand sellers of music and movies who are suffering from a boom\nin downloads from the likes of Apple's iTunes. Woolworths WLW.L and HMV HMV.L issued profit warnings\nbefore Christmas while Music Zone, a privately-owned DVD and CD\nstore, filed for administration on Wednesday. Data from Internet tracker Hitwise showed visits to music\ndownload sites rose 50 percent from Christmas Day 2005.\n\n\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/britain-christmas-internet-idUSN0342758920070103", "sectors": [], "title": "update 1 - online retailers winners in uk christmas trading"},

{"date": "15:26 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " (Adds Kremlin reaction, background) By Andrei MakhovskyMINSK Jan 3 (Reuters) - Belarus slapped big new charges on\nRussian oil crossing its territory on Wednesday, causing\nheadaches for refiners in northern Europe and further\nunravelling Belarus' once cordial ties with the Kremlin. Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko -- described by\nWashington as Europe's last dictator -- imposed transit duty of\n$45 per tonne on Russian oil in retaliation for Moscow cutting\nsubsidies on energy supplies to Belarus. One million barrels of oil a day, or about a fifth of\nRussian exports, pass through Belarus. Most of that crude goes\nto refiners in Poland and Germany. Market watchers said the transit duty would not affect world\noil prices or cause shortages but it was likely to cause\nshort-term disruption to the supply chain as refiners in Poland\nand Germany look for cheaper alternative supplies of crude. \"I do not exclude the Belarussians could do something weird,\nwhich may paralyse Russian oil exports to Europe,\" one trader\nwith a Russian oil major told Reuters. \"The volumes in question -- to Poland and Germany -- are\nhuge. I am coming to work tomorrow despite the holidays.\" Russia has been Lukashenko's closest ally after the\ntough-talking former collective farm boss was cold-shouldered by\nthe West over his human rights record.  But the Belarus leader angrily denounced Moscow for\n\"extremely unfriendly steps\" toward its neighbour and said the\ntransit tariffs were his response. \"If Russia, choking on this influx of petrodollars ..., is\nstill willing to make a scapegoat of Belarus ... then let's ask\nthe Russian Federation -- so huge and so rich -- to pay us in\nfull for our services,\" state news agency BelTA quoted\nLukashenko as saying.\n TIT-FOR-TAT Lukashenko has been angered by Moscow imposing full duties\non exports of Russian crude to Belarus. This oil is treated\nseparately from transit crude. Until now, this fuel has been shipped duty free to\nrefineries in Belarus and then re-exported as refined products\nto other countries in a lucrative tax loophole. Further angering the Belarus leader, his government was\nforced on Jan. 1 to agree to pay twice the previous level for\nnatural gas it imports from Russia. Officials in Moscow said they wanted clarification from the\nBelarus government about the new charge on oil transit. \"Questions arise as to the substance of the measures, which\nwas not explained by the Belarussian side,\" Kremlin deputy\nspokesman Dmitry Peskov said. \"There are also some questions about how it could be imposed\non Jan 3, effective from Jan. 1. We need additional details to\nanalyse this decision.\" Sergei Grigoriyev, Vice-President of Russia's oil pipeline\nmonopoly Transneft, told Reuters he did not understand how\nBelarus could impose the duty on Russian oil.  He said though if there was to be a charge it should be\nnegotiated by the two countries' economy ministers. The transit duty was announced to reporters by Lukashenko's\nPrime Minister Sergei Sidorsky. Up to now Belarus has charged a\nshipping fee on Russian oil pumped across its territory but no\ntransit duty. Moscow says its ex-Soviet neighbours -- even those closely\nallied to it like Belarus -- should be weaned off subsidies and\nstart paying market prices for energy. Some in Minsk though see that policy as a betrayal of the\nspecial relationship between Moscow and Belarus. The two\ncountries are talking about merging into a single state, as they\nwere for centuries before the Soviet Union broke up. Just days ago, a different row between Minsk and Moscow over\nenergy briefly threatened to disrupt supplies of natural gas\nfrom Russian to Europe. Belarus threatened to disable a gas pipeline across its\nterritory if a deal was not reached with Gazprom on new prices.\nMinsk backed down at the last minute.\n (Additional reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov in Moscow)\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/belarus-russia-idUSL0371417220070103", "sectors": [], "title": "update 3 - belarus slaps duty on russian oil exports"},

He declined to provide details about the U.S. forces.The Islamists, who deserted their last stronghold on Monday after two weeks of war against Somali government troops backed by Ethiopia, have pledged to fight on after melting into the hills between the Indian Ocean port of Kismayu and Kenya.McCormack did not name specific extremists, but U.S. officials said before the war the top layer of the Somalia Islamic Courts Council (SICC) was controlled by a cell of al Qaeda operatives. The head of the council, Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys, is on U.N. and U.S. extremist lists.During the six-month rule of the Islamists, U.S. officials tried with no success to persuade the SICC to give up three suspects wanted for the 1998 bomb attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania who Washington believed were in Somalia.Somali Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi said on Tuesday that pro-Islamic fighters from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Arab countries were taken prisoner during the fighting.\"FAILED STATE\" STATUSThe United States set up the Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa in 2002 in Djibouti, where a former French Foreign Legion base serves as a major hub for U.S. counter-terrorism training and operations as well as humanitarian efforts.Members of that 1,800-member task force have also trained with troops in Ethiopia, and U.S. ships patrol the nearby Gulf of Aden, according to Pentagon documents.Asked about the widely shared assumption that Ethiopia's two-week campaign to oust Somalia's Islamists enjoyed U.S. blessing, McCormack said Washington had preferred a negotiated settlement.\"But it became apparent over time, and certainly very apparent in the recent weeks, that that wasn't going to happen and that the Islamic courts were intent upon trying to seize control over all of Somalia through use of arms,\" he said.\"There were real concerns about the composition of the leadership of those Islamic courts,\" McCormack added.The State Department would announce plans later on Wednesday to send humanitarian aid to Somalia, he said.Jendayi Frazer, assistant secretary of state for African affairs, would co-host a meeting on Friday in Kenya aimed at finding ways to help Mogadishu and \"to move Somalia out of the category of a failed state,\" the spokesman said.Frazer was in the Ethiopian capital for meetings with the leaders of Ethiopia and Uganda.

His last major appearance on the public stage, at an Asian foreign ministers' gathering in Kuala Lumpur in July 2006, saw him being wheeled around on a golf cart.Paek rebuffed calls to hold a joint meeting there with other foreign ministers to discuss the North's nuclear plans. Pyongyang conducted its first nuclear test three months later, on October 9.\"Leader Kim Jong-il Wednesday sent a wreath to the bier of the late Foreign Minister Paek Nam-sun, deputy to the DPRK (North Korea) Supreme People's Assembly, expressing deep condolences over his death,\" the official KCNA news agency said. It gave no further details.Analysts said at the time the choice of Paek to head Pyongyang's foreign service was surprising because he was better known as a cadre familiar with South Korea than as a career diplomat.Born on March 13, 1929, in the northern province of Ryanggang, Paek was involved for many years with the North Korean Red Cross, a main channel of communication with the South.Paek led the North Korean Red Cross shipment of rice in 1984 after the South was hit by extensive flooding, and he visited the South as late as 1990 for initial talks during fledgling attempts at inter-Korean dialogue.A heavy-set man with a history of illness, Paek often sought medical help during his few visits overseas, Seoul government sources familiar with the North said.One of his last flourishes as foreign minister came at a meeting of Association of South East Asian Nations ministers in Vientiane in 2005 where he held talks with several foreign ministers, including the South's Ban Ki-moon.The meeting with Ban, who this week became U.N. secretary-general, was only the third meeting of foreign ministers from the divided Korean peninsula. A smiling Paek shook hands with Ban for the cameras and, in their talks, tried to calm fears about the North's nuclear plans.Ban, through a statement from U.N. spokeswoman Michele Montas, offered condolences on Paek's death.\"The Secretary-General hopes that the death of Foreign Minister Paek does not, in any case, hinder the ongoing six-party process or the way for North Korea's foreign policy to open up to the international community,\" Ban said.State Department spokesman Sean McCormack offered condolences to Paek's family. He said he did not know what impact Paek's death might have on the nuclear talks because that question \"gets to the internal workings of the North Korean regime.\"(With additional reporting by Jon Herskovitz, Evelyn Leopold at the UNITED NATIONS and Paul Eckert in WASHINGTON)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-korea-north-minister-idUSSEO14467220070103", "sectors": [["World"]], "title": "north korean foreign minister paek nam - sun dies"},

Gold initially gained on fund buying, traded as high as\n$647.30 an ounce, near its four-week high of $648.80. But the February contract turned south by late morning,\nhitting a low of $627.00, as the dollar reversed course and\ngained broadly after a survey showed the U.S. factory sector\nexpanded in December. Scott Meyers, senior analyst at Pioneer Futures, attributed\ngold's decline to a sharply higher currency and plunging energy\nprices. \"After the initial rally, there's just no follow-through\nearly on. I think that the gold just ran out of steam early,\"\nMeyers said. \"Everybody thought that we would have a rally. The rally\nfell apart.

{"date": "16:04 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "BOSTON Massachusetts Republican Gov. Mitt Romney, a former venture capitalist credited with turning around the scandal-hit Salt Lake City Olympics in 2002, took the first steps on Wednesday toward a 2008 White House bid.Romney, 59, said he had filed papers with the Federal Election Commission in Washington to establish a presidential exploratory committee and fund-raising apparatus. A Romney aide said afterward that the paperwork was not due at the FEC until later on Wednesday.\"I have a feeling we are going to be pretty busy,\" Romney told reporters outside his office in Massachusetts. \"We have filed exploratory papers today. So the process is moving forward on that front.\"A devout Mormon and former bishop in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Romney -- the son of former Michigan Gov. George Romney -- has several advantages, political analysts say.He is a polished communicator with an actor's good looks. He gained national attention for rescuing the 2002 Olympics and earned degrees from both Harvard business and law schools before going on to make millions in business.But as a one-term governor from a state with a liberal reputation, Romney still has hurdles to overcome among conservative Republicans, who are a major force in the party's nominating process. He has no foreign policy experience and has made conflicting statements on some social issues.\"One of his stiffest obstacles is his continuing support for the war in Iraq. He's been unwavering in his belief that President Bush is following the right path,\" said Jeffrey Berry, a professor at Tufts University.Romney has cast himself as a social conservative to the right of both Arizona Sen. John McCain and former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, two of the early Republican favorites.He has courted Republican donors, met with prominent evangelical leaders, huddled with lobbyists in Washington and recently hired advertising specialist Alex Castellanos, who worked on President George W. Bush's 2000 campaign.SOCIAL STANCESSome conservatives, however, are bothered by his inconsistent record on social issues such as gay rights and abortion, which he said in 1994 should stay \"safe and legal\" before more recently declaring himself \"firmly pro-life.\"In a failed 1994 bid to unseat Sen. Edward Kennedy, Romney told a prominent gay rights group he would be better in fighting discrimination against gays and lesbians than his rival, and he endorsed federal gay rights legislation. As governor, his stance changed and his policies tilted further to the right.\"It's easy to visualize the TV commercials that will be used against him. His opponents in Republican primaries will make sure that every voter in each state will know that he has reversed course on critical social issues,\" said Berry.He also must overcome skepticism over what some Republicans call the \"Mormon thing.\" Mormon leaders have spent decades countering critics who dismiss the faith as a cult and a threat to Christianity.The once-isolated sect based in Salt Lake City, Utah, is one of the world's fastest growing and most affluent religions, with 12.3 million members globally. But its past could haunt a Romney presidential campaign, including its now-severed links to polygamy and a former ban on blacks from leadership roles.(Additional reporting by Kevin McNicholas)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-usa-presidential-romney-idUSN0339937820070103", "sectors": [["Politics"]], "title": "mitt romney says files papers for white house run"},

{"date": "16:17 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "NEW YORK The health-conscious often shun whole milk but a new study suggests that adults who favor full-fat dairy gain less weight over time.Swedish researchers found that among more than 19,000 middle-aged women, those who had at least one serving of whole milk or cheese each day put on less weight over the next 9 years than women who consumed these foods less often.The potential role of dairy foods in weight control won much attention after some recent studies suggested that milk, yogurt and other dairy foods might help regulate body fat. However, the picture is far from clear, as other research has failed to find that dairy products benefit the waistline.The new findings, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, are unlikely to clear up the confusion.For one thing, only whole milk, and not low-fat milk, seemed to offer protection against weight gain. For another, the benefit was seen only among women who were normal-weight at the start of the study.It's always possible that the associations between dairy intake and weight gain do not reflect a direct action of dairy foods at all, according to Dr. Magdalena Rosell, a researcher at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and the study's lead author.Eating habits can be seen as a marker of overall lifestyle, and women who favored whole milk might have had other habits that aided their weight control, Rosell told Reuters Health.It's also possible that women who had already been gaining weight opted to drink low-fat milk -- making the milk a \"marker,\" but not a cause, of weight gain, according to Rosell.The findings are based on data from 19,352 women ages 40 to 55 who were surveyed about their diets, weight and other health factors at the study's outset and again 9 years later.Women who said they had whole milk or cheese at least once a day throughout the study period were less likely to report a significant weight gain -- defined as 2 pounds or more per year.One theory on why dairy products have been linked to lower body weight is that the calcium aids in fat regulation, but a number of studies have refuted that notion. The new findings cast further doubt, since low-fat milk showed no positive weight effects.It's possible, according to Rosell, that a type of fat found in dairy foods called conjugated linoleic acid, or CLA, aids in weight control.However, she added, there's not enough evidence yet to support that idea. At this point, there's no reason, Rosell said, for people to eschew the general advice to choose low-fat dairy products, which are lower in artery-clogging saturated fats.\"From what we know today, I do not see any reasons to change that recommendation,\" she said.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-dairy-weight-s-idUSSP13829620070103", "sectors": [["U.S., ", "Health"]], "title": "full - fat dairy products linked to lower weight , study says"},

Overall spreads tightened 4 basis points to 167 points\nabove safe-haven U.S. Treasuries, according to JP Morgan's\nEmerging Markets Bond Index Plus (EMBI+)11EMJ.JPMEMBIPLUS.\nTotal returns rose 0.53 percent. Yields of the 10-year Treasury note US10YT=RR eased to\n4.67 percent compared with 4.68 percent. Bond yields and prices\nmove inversely. The concern over potentially slower growth helped to\nmarginally boost investor expectations that the Fed may be\nconsidering the possibility of an official interest rate cut\nlater this year. Lower U.S. rates free up money for investors to put into\nhigh-risk emerging market bonds. Emerging market investors are experiencing a dream scenario\nthat includes a moderate slowdown of the U.S. economy that\nwould not hurt demand for exports from developing economies but\nwould allow U.S. rates to remain stable. Meanwhile, Ecuador's sovereign bond spreads tightened 50\nbasis points to 872 bps on the EMBI+ after the country's\nEconomy Minister designate Ricardo Patino said he was\nconsidering forcing bondholders to accept a buyback of the\nglobal bonds due in 2012 ECUGLB12=RR by threatening not to\npay interest. Patino said a buyback managed through a Dutch action \"is an\nalternative.\" For details see [ID:nN03406083]. A Dutch auction\nstarts with an asking price that moves downward until it is\naccepted by a bidder. \"The Dutch auction comments are positive. It is very\ndifficult to say exactly what it means, because they could\noffer half the price or a 5 to 10 basis (points) haircut, but\nthe market has interpreted it as they won't default,\" said\nMarjorie Hernandez, emerging markets analyst at HSBC. Ecuador's global bond due in 2012 was 1.688 percentage\npoints higher to bid 80.188 in price and to yield 19.269\npercent. \"The incoming administration does not, at this stage, know\nwith precision which strategy it intends to follow or even what\nlevel of debt service relief it is seeking,\" said Alberto\nRamos, senior economist at Goldman Sachs.

The government has already made abundantly clear that\nservicing external debt is possibly at the bottom of its\nspending priorities, Ramos said.

{"date": "16:23 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "WASHINGTON A skin patch relieved symptoms of people with early-stage Parkinson's disease, and may offer advantages to taking pills to treat the progressive brain disorder, researchers reported on Wednesday.The study, involving 277 people in Canada and the United States with early-stage Parkinson's, assessed the Neupro patch, made by Germany's Schwarz Pharma. It delivers a drug called rotigotine that acts like a certain brain chemical that is deficient in people with the disease.Patients who wore the patch showed a significant easing of their symptoms after six months of treatment, according to the study in the journal Neurology. Those getting a placebo saw their symptoms get worse, the study found.The study was funded by Schwarz Pharma.The patch is applied once a day and delivers rotigotine continuously through the skin. Currently, many patients take pills at least three times a day to treat symptoms of the incurable disease.\"I think it's an important new development for Parkinson's patients. For a significant portion of patients, this may offer real advantages,\" Dr. Ray Watts, chairman of the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Department of Neurology and leader of the study, said in an interview.Parkinson's affects nerve cells in the area of the brain that controls muscle movement, and is characterized by a shortage of the brain chemical dopamine. Rotigotine imitates the effects of dopamine and helps make up for the shortage.The disease's main symptoms are trembling in the hands, arms, legs, jaw and face, muscle rigidity, slowness of movement and impaired balance and coordination. The symptoms, which worsen over time, usually develop after age 60.The study did not directly compare the patch to pills currently used to treat the disease.The study unique in testing a new delivery system for a dopamine-related drug, Watts said. The patch can provide a steady dose over 24 hours, allowing for a more uniform delivery of medication to the brain than pills might provide, he added.\"Patients who are doing well now on current agents, as long as they're OK taking medication three times a day, there may or may not be an advantage to switching.\"But for newly diagnosed patients, especially younger patients who are going to be treated for a long time, this may be even more important,\" Watts said.The patients were recruited into the study from November 2001 through April 2003.Schwarz Pharma official Michael Davis said the company expects to win approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the patch to treat early-stage Parkinson's disease in the first half of this year.

{"date": "16:12 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " (Adds ExxonMobil comment, paragraphs 3, 17-19) By Deborah Zabarenko, Environment CorrespondentWASHINGTON Jan 3 (Reuters) - Energy giant ExxonMobil\nborrowed tactics from the tobacco industry to raise doubt about\nclimate change, spending $16 million on groups that question\nglobal warming, a science watchdog group said on Wednesday. \"ExxonMobil (XOM.N) has manufactured uncertainty about the\nhuman causes of global warming just as tobacco companies denied\ntheir product caused lung cancer,\" Alden Meyer of the Union of\nConcerned Scientists said at a telephone news conference\nreleasing the report. An ExxonMobil spokesman dismissed the report as \"an attempt\nto connect unrelated facts, draw inaccurate conclusions and\nmislead the audience with a fiction about ExxonMobil's true\npositions.\" The union, a nonprofit group based in Cambridge,\nMassachusetts, said ExxonMobil, the world's biggest publicly\ntraded corporation, had succeeded in parlaying a relatively\nmodest investment into unwarranted public doubt on findings\nthat have been overwhelmingly endorsed by mainstream science. ExxonMobil did this by using the same methods used for\ndecades by the U.S. tobacco industry, the report said,\nincluding: -- raising doubts about even the most undisputed science; -- funding a variety of front organizations to create the\nappearance of a broad platform; -- recruiting a number of vocal climate change\ncontrarians; -- portraying its opposition to action as a quest for\n\"sound science\" rather than business self-interest; -- using its access to the Bush administration to shape\nfederal communications and policies on global warming. TOBACCO TACTICS U.S. tobacco companies used these tactics for decades to\nhide the hazards of smoking, and were found liable in federal\ncourt last year for violating racketeering laws. Global warming has been blamed for stronger hurricanes,\nmore wildfires and worse droughts. While there have been cycles\nof warming and cooling throughout Earth's history, the last 30\nyears have seen a steep warming trend which most scientists say\nis due to emission of so-called greenhouse gases by the burning\nof fossil fuels in vehicles, factories and power plants. ExxonMobil has funded legitimate scientific studies on\nclimate change, the watchdog report said, but noted it has also\nspent approximately $16 million between 1998 and 2005 on 43\norganizations that have cast doubt on the reality of\nhuman-caused global warming. The report said these have ranged from $30,000 for the\ngroup Africa Fighting Malaria, which argues on its Web site\nagainst urgent action on climate change, to $1.6 million to the\nAmerican Enterprise Institute, a pro-business think tank in\nWashington. James McCarthy, professor of biological oceanography and\ndirector of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard\nUniversity, noted a 2005 statement issued by the U.S. National\nAcademy of Sciences and 10 science academies from other\ncountries, affirming that \"climate change is now sufficiently\nclear to justify nations taking prompt action.\" \"This report reveals for the first time the degree to which\nefforts to exaggerate uncertainty in climate science produce\nnon scientific reports designed to cast doubt on published\nscientific climate studies have been orchestrated by\nExxonMobil,\" McCarthy said at the news conference. Company spokesman Dave Gardner said in an e-mail that the\ncompany acknowledged the burning of fossil fuels is a major\nsource of greenhouse gas emissions. He said ExxonMobil supports various public policy groups\nbut said financial support does not mean it has control over\nthe groups' positions. \"We find some of them persuasive and enlightening, and some\nnot. But there is value in the debate they prompt if it can\nlead to better informed and more optimal public policy\ndecisions,\" Gardner said.\n\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/environment-exxonmobil-idUSN0343235220070103", "sectors": [], "title": "update 1 - exxonmobil cultivates global warming doubt - report"},

{"date": "16:32 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Hollywood returned to its buccaneering ways last year as box office champ \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\" helped overall ticket sales recover from 2005's downturn.As the final numbers are tallied, last year's total national box office appears headed to an estimated $9.46 billion, up nearly 5% from $8.99 billion in 2005. 2006 becomes the fourth-best year on record. The record holder is 2004 with $9.54 billion, followed by 2002 with $9.52 billion and 2003 with $9.49 billion.The number of tickets sold is expected to total about 1.44 billion, up nearly 3% from 2005's 1.4 billion. The modern-day record was set in 2002 with 1.64 billion. (Admissions were higher in the 1940s and early 1950s before the spread of TV.)With $423.3 million in its domestic coffers, \"Dead Man's Chest\" proved more popular than the first film in the trilogy, 2003's \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,\" which pulled in $305.4 million. The sequel also outgrossed 2005's top film, \"Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith,\" which collected $380.3 million.Even before the latest \"Pirates\" set sail on the weekend of July 7, last year's box office tally had begun to improve on the downbeat returns of 2005 when alarmists were predicting that moviegoers were abandoning theaters en masse.With megaplexes working overtime to accommodate the crowds that thronged to \"Dead Man's Chest\" -- which established new one-day, opening-day and opening-weekend records -- a box office revival was assured.Buena Vista Pictures, the distribution arm of the Walt Disney Co., grabbed the top two spots with its summer doubleheader of \"Dead Man's Chest\" and Pixar Animation Studios' \"Cars,\" the top animated film in a year crowded with cartoons, which steered its way to $244.1 million.Sony Pictures, the market-share leader for 2006, dominated the top 25 with seven titles, led by the theological thriller \"The Da Vinci Code,\" with $217.5 million. 20th Century Fox followed with five entries, including the third-best-grossing domestic film of the year, \"X-Men: The Last Stand,\" the comic book adaptation that grabbed $234.4 million.PG-13 films proliferated, with 12 of the top 25 bearing that rating. PG-rated movies accounted for seven. While only two G-rated movies cracked the top 25, there were four R-rated films, led by the rude and rowdy \"Borat,\" in 14th place with a gross-to-date of $125.8 million.Familiarity bred success in 2006. Six of the top 25 movies were sequels, and three movies -- \"Superman Returns\" ($200.1 million), \"Casino Royale\" ($154.9 million) and \"The Pink Panther\" ($82.2 million) -- relaunched long-running series.But there still was room for originality and surprise. With \"Borat,\" high-wire performance artist Sacha Baron Cohen moved from cable TV cult status to movie star virtually overnight. Meryl Streep's commandingly sly performance in \"The Devil Wears Prada\" helped that comedy break out of the women's film ghetto and connect with a broad-based audience to the tune of $124.7 million. And trading in the wiseguys of New York for the Southies of Boston, Martin Scorsese enjoyed the biggest hit of his career with \"The Departed,\" which has taken in more than $120 million to date.Reuters/Hollywood Reporter", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-boxoffice-year-idUSN0235967120070103", "sectors": [["Entertainment, ", "Film"]], "title": "pirates sequel buoyed box office in 2006"},

If Johnson had to leave the Senate, a Republican likely would be appointed to finish the last two years of his term. That would make for an evenly split chamber, with Vice President Dick Cheney, the president of the Senate, able to cast tie-breaking votes.Johnson could be out for months, but still hold his seat. A Senate seat becomes vacant through death or resignation.On December 13, Johnson was admitted to George Washington University Hospital, where doctors performed emergency surgery to stop a brain hemorrhage caused by malformed blood vessels.Dr. Vivek Deshmukh said tests were performed on Wednesday that showed no evidence of residual malformation of blood vessels following the surgery.Doctors also said Johnson developed fluid in his lungs as a result of the initial hemorrhage and was placed on a ventilator to help him breathe.\"His breathing has steadily improved and now he only requires assistance at night,\" Deshmukh said.Deshmukh said Johnson continues to be responsive to family and doctors, \"following commands, squeezing his wife's hand and understanding speech.\"", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-usa-congress-senator-idUSN0342830820070103", "sectors": [["U.S., ", "Politics"]], "title": "sen . johnson faces long recovery : aides"},

Stennis strike group would deploy this month. It will put 5,000 more U.S. sailors in the region, bringing the total to 16,000.The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier group entered the Gulf in December.Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman declined to comment, saying the Defense Department would not discuss future deployments or ship movements. But military analysts said the move was intended to demonstrate U.S. resolve in the face of acts by Iran and Syria that it sees as provocative, such as Tehran's pursuit of its nuclear program.The Stennis had been scheduled to deploy to the Pacific region. But the Pentagon agreed instead to send the carrier group to the Gulf after a request from U.S. Central Command, the military command responsible for Middle East operations.Senior defense officials have said that request was aimed at increasing Central Command's flexibility in a variety of operations and providing deterrence in the region.INCREASED U.S. PRESENCEWashington has locked horns with Tehran over the Iranian nuclear program. American defense officials also regularly charge Iran and Syria with fanning sectarian violence in Iraq and contributing to the deteriorating situation there by providing arms and technologies.The second carrier, while adding relatively few service members to the region, is valuable as a symbol of America's increased presence in the Gulf, military analysts said.Longer term, however, the Bush administration must decide if it will keep two carrier groups in the Gulf indefinitely.Defense Secretary Robert Gates previously said the increased American presence in the Gulf was a message to the region as a whole and not a response to any specific action by Iran.\"I think the message that we are sending to everyone, not just Iran, is that the United States is an enduring presence in this part of the world,\" Gates told reporters on a December visit to Baghdad. \"We will be here for a long time and everybody needs to remember that -- both our friends and those who might consider themselves our adversaries.\"(Additional reporting by Jim Wolf)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-usa-gulf-navy-idUSN0319010320070103", "sectors": [], "title": "second u . s . carrier group to deploy to gulf : sources"},
{"date": "16:41 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " (Recasts lead paragraph, updates prices) By Chris ReeseNEW YORK Jan 3 (Reuters) - U.S. government bond prices\nrose on Wednesday on weak private-sector jobs data and minutes\nfrom the last Federal Reserve policy meeting that showed a\ncentral bank wary of slowing economic growth. Price gains were tempered, however, by a\nstronger-than-expected U.S. factory activity index for\nDecember. The Fed's concern over potentially slower growth, expressed\nin the minutes of its Dec. 12 policy meeting, helped to\nmarginally boost investor expectations that the central bank\nmay be considering the possibility of an official interest rate\ncut later this year. \"One bullish item for Treasuries was that several members\nof the Fed monetary policy committee saw a 'subdued tone' to\nthe economic data and thought the downside risk to growth had\nincreased,\" said Cary Leahey, managing director at Decision\nEconomics in New York. Leahey cautioned however that a good portion of the\nindicators released since the December meeting have shown an\neconomy that is looking more resilient, and the central bank's\nconcern over slowing growth was based on relatively old data. \"The one headline that could be viewed as bullish for bonds\nis probably, correctly, considered by the market to be out of\ndate,\" Leahey said. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR traded 5/32 higher in\nprice for a yield of 4.66 percent from 4.68 percent late on\nTuesday. Treasuries rallied early in the day after a surprise\ncontraction in a private jobs report which hinted the nonfarm\npayrolls report on Friday could prove soft. After the data,\neconomists at some Wall Street banks cut their forecasts for\nthe government's nonfarm payrolls report. The ADP National Employment Report showed U.S. private\nsector employment likely declined by 40,000 in December, the\nfirst contraction since April 2003. \"Clearly, going into the employment data this Friday,\npeople coming into the New Year with a clean book would\ncertainly feel that this (the ADP report) is something people\nwant to be buying bonds on,\" said Michael Cheah, vice president\nand portfolio manager with AIG SunAmerica Asset Management in\nJersey City, New Jersey. However, those early bond gains were later tempered by\nstronger-than-expected U.S. factory data. The Institute for\nSupply Management's December manufacturing report reading was\n51.4, above the 50 mark that divides expansion from\ncontraction. Economists had forecast the index would rise to\n49.9 from November's 49.5 reading. Two-year notes US2YT=RR traded 2/32 higher in price for a\nyield of 4.77 percent from 4.81 percent late on Tuesday, while\nfive-year notes US5YT=RR traded 3/32 higher in price for a\nyield of 4.66 percent from 4.68 percent.

Her captor, a 44-year-old man, committed suicide hours after she slipped away.Kampusch spoke in a 50-minute Austrian ORF television special that featured a dramatic reconstruction of her kidnapping, captivity and escape.She recalled the day she was walking to school when Wolfgang Priklopil pulled alongside in a white van and forced her inside.\"I had already noticed him following me from some distance away and thought to myself, 'What is this guy doing here?' Somehow I had a gut feeling, I knew, that something was wrong, he seemed weird,\" Kampusch related.\"But I didn't cross the street because I was afraid to get run over. I thought it wasn't necessary. I didn't want to make a fool out of myself, so I just kept on walking (where I was).\"As Priklopil drove off with his captive, Kampusch said, \"I gave a silent scream ... I made peace with myself, (reckoning) that I wouldn't be around much longer.\"Once marooned in the gloomy underground cell, she stayed awake for days for fear Priklopil might otherwise molest her.\"I couldn't see in the darkness, I could just hear things. I could hear my blood rushing. I could sense the narrowness, the cold, I pondered (my situation) a lot,\" Kampusch said.\"I had this crazy, unhealthy feeling of always hoping he (Priklopil) wouldn't die, so that I wouldn't rot away, never be found. On the other hand I prayed that something awful would befall him, so that this whole thing would end.\"STARVATION DIETShe also described how Priklopil kept her on a virtual starvation diet. \"He had a very pronounced miserliness when it came to food. And he was almost like an anorexic who wanted to pass this (ailment) on to other people.\"She said Priklopil gave her books, a television and a portable music player, but often behaved like a nasty child.\"But naturally there's a difference between a 3-year-old kicking you and screaming at you, getting angry with you ... and a 1.72-meter (5 foot-6 inch) tall and strong man doing that.\"On the day she escaped, Kampusch said, \"I no longer had much bleeding or injuries, and I felt strong enough to run away\".She made her escape when Priklopil was distracted by a phone call as she was cleaning his car in the driveway of his home.Reinhard Haller, a court psychiatrist who has been among Kampusch's counsellors as she reintegrates in daily life, said the kidnap investigation indicated that Priklopil had picked out Kampusch for abduction some time before he snatched her.\"It was not the case that she entered his realm purely by chance, rather he had been observing her for awhile,\" he said.\"Priklopil was a lonely person with great problems making contact, especially with women. He wanted to form a person who would be there just for him, dependent on him...\"ORF said Priklopil inspected the rubbish from his house to ensure Kampusch had not slipped in a message calling for help.He also appeared to have monitored Kampusch's family while he held her prisoner and told his young captive about it.Brigitta Sirny, Kampusch's mother, said on ORF that her daughter told her after the escape that she knew her family had a new car and that her sister smoked.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-austria-kampusch-idUSL0321200720070103", "sectors": [["World"]], "title": "hesitation to flee put kampusch in abductor ' s hands"},

Procter & Gamble (PG.N) raised list prices for Folgers roast\nand ground coffee by 4 percent, or up 10 cents per 11.5 and 13\nounce equivalent small-sized canister, spokesman Lars Atorf\nsaid. P&G also increased the Folgers gourmet selections by 20\ncents per 11.5 ounce equivalent, a 5 percent increase, Atorf\nsaid. \"This price move is reflecting the sustained green coffee\nprice increase for arabica beans on the New York arabica 'C'\nmarket,\" Atorf said. There were no more price moves planned at this time, Atorf\nsaid. Roasters typically buy green coffee beans, roast them and\npackage them to be sold as either ground or whole beans. Arabica coffee trades on the New York Board of Trade, and\ndealers said that other roasters typically follow suit after one\ncompany makes the first move. \"Usually when one goes, they all go,\" one NYBOT trader\nsaid.

{"date": "16:32 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " (Adds statement from AFL-CIO in paragraphs 9-10) By Martha GraybowNEW YORK Jan 3 (Reuters) - Robert Nardelli's\nmultimillion-dollar pay as chief of Home Depot Inc. (HD.N) made\nhim, and the retailer, a favorite target of shareholder activists.\nNow, his exit package is giving critics a new round of\nammunition. Nardelli stepped down from his job as chairman and chief\nexecutive on Wednesday, walking away with about $210 million in a\nseverance deal -- the equivalent of about $96,000 for every day of\nhis 6-year tenure. The payout comes on top of earnings of at least $119.2 million\nin salary and bonus, not including options, that Nardelli, 58,\ncollected as CEO through the end of fiscal 2006. All the while, Home Depot shares lost nearly 8 percent of\ntheir value during Nardelli's tenure. \"He should be giving money back, not taking more money out,\"\nsaid Nell Minow, co-founder of The Corporate Library, a research\ngroup that rates companies' governance practices. \"Performance has\nbeen poor and he has been hugely overpaid every step of the way.\" Investor activists have a long list of complaints over how\nHome Depot is run -- and they say the board should have cut a much\nless generous exit deal with Nardelli. The Atlanta-based company has been under pressure amid\nweakening sales and profits and it faces a regulatory probe into\nits stock options award practices. It drew particular wrath last\nyear when board members skipped the 2006 annual meeting amid\ncriticism of Nardelli's compensation. \"The golden parachute he's been given is not acceptable to\nshareholders,\" said Richard Ferlauto, director or pension and\nbenefit policy at the American Federation of State County and\nMunicipal Employees, a union umbrella group that has been critical\nof executive compensation. The AFL-CIO on Wednesday called on Home Depot to freeze all\npayments to Nardelli until the company can determine whether the\ncompensation pact was properly entered into and whether the former\nCEO \"complied with his obligations under those agreements.\" The union group also called for the resignation of lead\ndirector Kenneth Langone, who was sued by the New York attorney\ngeneral's office over the pay package of former New York Stock\nExchange chairman Richard Grasso in a separate case. The group\nsaid it also wants further disclosure from the company about the\nfindings of an internal probe into the timing of stock options\nawards. Janna Sampson, a fund manager at OakBrook Investments outside\nChicago that holds about 513,000 Home Depot shares, said the board\nlikely had little choice but to give Nardelli the large payout --\nas his severance terms were outlined in his employment agreement. The company is paying a \"pretty steep price\" to get rid of\nNardelli, she said. But Home Depot \"may be trying to remove what\nhad become kind of a block to moving forward.\" Some politicians were quick to weigh in on the exit package.\nNardelli's severance is \"further confirmation of the need to deal\nwith a pattern of CEO pay that appears to be out of control,\" said\nU.S. Rep. Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services\nCommittee. MONEY, MONEY, MONEY Home Depot isn't the only company that's come under criticism\nrecently for payouts to outgoing chiefs. Ex-Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) CEO Hank McKinnell, who was replaced\nfollowing a steep decline in the company's market value, will get\nabout $198 million upon his departure. Meanwhile, shareholder watchdogs say they are awaiting details\nof how much the new Home Depot chief, 57-year-old Vice Chairman\nFrank Blake, will be paid. Both Nardelli and Blake were formerly\nexecutives at General Electric Co. (GE.N). \"My guess is the pay package (for Blake) is not going to be\nhigh profile -- his package will probably be more run of the\nmill,\" said Joseph Carcello, director of research at the\nUniversity of Tennessee's Corporate Governance Center. The company's board, he said, has been shown that \"you need to\nalign the compensation more closely with the returns to\nstockholders.\" But Minow, of the Corporate Library, which gives Home Depot an\n\"F\" grade for overall governance practices, says that it won't be\nclear if the board has learned its lessons until the specifics of\nthe new CEO's pay package are released. \"We will get a chance to see if they have learned from their\nmistakes,\" she said. \"Based on this departure package, it looks\nlike they haven't.\" (Additional reporting by Joseph Giannone)\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/homedepot-nardelli-exitpackage-idUSN0343153820070103", "sectors": [], "title": "update 1 - home depot still needs to learn lessons , critics say"},

The dollar jumped after the Institute for Supply Management\nsaid its manufacturing index climbed to 51.4 from 49.5 in\nNovember and above the 50 threshold that separates expansion\nand contraction. For details, see [nnN03391475] The dollar pared gains midafternoon after the release of\nminutes from the Federal Reserve's December policy meeting even\nas the overall trend for the greenback remained up on the day.\nThe minutes indicated the central bank sees increased downside\nrisks to economic growth even as inflation remained the\npredominant concern. \"The fact that ISM came back above 50 puts the whole\nsoft-landing, dollar-positive scenario back in play,\" said\nBoris Schlossberg, senior currency strategist at Forex Capital\nMarkets in New York. Led by strong gains against European currencies including\nsterling, the euro and the Swiss franc, the dollar had its\nbiggest rise in around six months against a basket of six major\ncurrencies .DXY. The euro EUR= was trading down 0.9 percent on the day at\n$1.3159, its biggest one-day decline since mid-July of last\nyear.

Participants in the policy-making Federal Open Market\nCommittee meeting said the slowdown in the housing sector\ncontinued to weigh heavily on economic activity in the United\nStates. Although there was evidence that home sales might be\nstabilizing, residential investment was likely to fall further\nin coming quarters as builders reduced inventories, officials\nfelt. \"The minutes are very much 'permanent hold' kind of minutes\nand I think they reflect an FOMC that was discussing a somewhat\nmore downbeat economy on Dec. 12,\" said Lara Rhame, senior FX\nstrategist at Credit Suisse in New York. Earlier in the session, the dollar had given up some ground\nafter a report showed employment in the U.S. private sector\ncontracted unexpectedly in December. [ID:nNAT002355] The soft report led some traders to speculate that the more\nclosely watched nonfarm payrolls report -- due on Friday --\ncould also come in softer than expectations. \"It points to a pretty poor payroll number on Friday,\" said\nShaun Osborne, senior currency strategist at TD Securities in\nToronto. A weak reading in that payrolls report would likely\nstrengthen the view that the Federal Reserve may start cutting\ninterest rates in coming months to shore up a slowing economy. Late afternoon in New York, the futures market was still\nonly pricing in a 12 percent chance of a rate cut by March,\nthough chances of a rate cut by July had edged up to 84 percent\nfrom 80 percent.

{"date": "16:51 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "NEW YORK Jan 3 Alltel Corp.'s (AT.N) credit\nspreads will widen significantly if the company is targeted in\na leveraged buyout, which many analysts view as a strong\npossibility. However, the wireless telecom company's credit default\nswaps are already trading much wider than its debt ratings\nimply, and if the company is instead bought by a competitor,\nsuch as Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ.N), they will narrow. The cost to insure Alltel's debt with credit default swaps\nhas doubled since early December on LBO speculation to around\n100 basis points on Wednesday, or $100,000 per year for five\nyears to insure $10 million in debt. \"The debt is going to be very volatile,\" said Zhiping Zhao,\nsenior analyst at research company CreditSights. If Alltel is bought in a leveraged buyout, its ratings\nwould go into junk territory and its spreads will widen by\nanother 100 basis points or more, Zhao said. If the company if bought by Verizon, however, its swaps\ncould trade in the 20 basis point area, she added. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that\nprivate-equity firms are exploring the idea of a leveraged\nbuyout for the fifth-largest U.S. wireless operator, resulting\nin a 25 basis point spread widening from 75 basis points. An Alltel spokesman said the company does not \"comment on\nspeculation.\" Spreads had also widened ahead of the report as speculation\nincreased the company may be a LBO target, said Dave Novosel,\nanalyst at New York-based Gimme Credit. \"If you look at the good cash flow they generate, solid\nmargins, very low leverage compared to many other telecom\noperators: that in of itself tends to be a good candidate\" for\nan LBO, he said. Smaller telecommunications companies are under pressure to\nconsolidate to cut costs and compete against larger firms. \"If you are a wireless player you need network coverage and\nquality,\" said CreditSights Zhao. Wireline operators,\nmeanwhile, need to reduce costs \"given that revenue is flat at\nbest,\" she added. \"The only way you can actually maintain your earnings per\nshare, or margin is to reduce costs,\" she said. Alltel is subscale and needs to do something to increase\nits size, Zhao said. The company is probably more attractive to\nprivate equity buyers than to Verizon, which is the most likely\nstrategic buyer, she added. Due to Alltel's low leverage, the buyer of the company has\na lot of potential to significantly increase its leverage and\nextract a lot of value from the firm, she said. From Verizon's perspective, however, other competitors such\nas Qwest Corp. (Q.N) may be more attractive as it would offer\ngreater synergies and cost reduction possibilities, Zhao said. Barclays Capital analysts have assigned a 70 percent\nprobability that Alltel may be sold to a private equity buyer\nif it is sold, compared with a 30 percent probability of a\nstrategic buyer. \"While we believe management's first preference might be to\nmerge with a strategic buyer, the relative lack of strategic\nbuyers versus the economics of an LBO may make the latter too\ncompelling to ignore,\" the analysts wrote in a research report\non Wednesday.\n\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/markets-credit-idUSN0356969220070103", "sectors": [["Bonds"]], "title": "us credit - lbo risk looms large over alltel ' s debt"},

{"date": "16:50 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "GARISSA, Kenya Kenyan soldiers and helicopters bolstered defenses at the Somali border on Wednesday to stop fighting from spilling over after Ethiopian warplanes attacked fleeing Islamists on the other side of the frontier.Kenya sealed the border after Somalia's interim government urged it to stop leaders of the Somalia Islamic Courts Council (SICC) or foreign jihadist supporters escaping.Seeking to block the escape of Islamist leaders by sea, the United States said its forces were deployed off the Horn of Africa nation's coast.The Islamists, who deserted their last stronghold on Monday after two weeks of war against government troops backed by Ethiopian armor, have pledged to fight on after melting into the hills between the Indian Ocean port of Kismayu and Kenya.\"We would be concerned that no leaders who were members of the Islamic Courts which have ties to terrorist organizations including al Qaeda are allowed to flee and leave Somalia,\" State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said in Washington.The Somali interim government is seeking to install itself in the capital Mogadishu, after breaking out from the provincial outpost of Baidoa, which had been threatened when the Islamists took over much of southern Somalia in June.Near Kenya's border with Somalia, a local police chief said a Kenyan helicopter had escaped undamaged after being shot at by Somali militia on Tuesday.Residents of Liboi, a Kenyan border post, said they saw Ethiopian fighter jets and helicopter gunships flying over the Somali town of Doble, 25 km (15 miles) away, late on Tuesday. They then heard shooting which tailed off after midnight.\"When we heard the gunshots we panicked, although we knew it could be these groups fighting across the border,\" said Liboi businessman Abdi Rage.\"The security forces are many here and it is like we are also involved in this fight. Vehicles are moving up and down the border. This is causing tension but at least we feel secure.\"Local police commander Johnstone Limo said the Ethiopian planes were pursuing Islamists nearby.\"Ethiopian planes fired missiles targeting three Somali vehicles. These were allegedly used by the fleeing Islamic forces, and the Ethiopian pilots missed their targets,\" he said.PEACEKEEPERS WANTEDEight suspected combatants were being questioned after they were arrested trying to enter Kenya on Sunday.One border security source said personnel were under strict orders not to let any Somalis into Kenya, while the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said 400 Somali asylum seekers had been sent back.\"Most of those in Liboi are women and children and they should not be sent back to a very uncertain situation,\" UNHCR head Antonio Guterres said in a statement.An ambush that killed at least one Ethiopian soldier in south Somalia on Tuesday showed that fighting may go on, despite the lightning military offensive by Ethiopian tanks, troops and jets that routed the Islamists from Mogadishu then Kismayu.Analysts say the Islamists, joined by some foreign fighters, may launch an Iraqi-style insurgency against a government they see as a puppet of Ethiopia, a hated and Christian-led power.Kenyan Foreign Minister Raphael Tuju said his country would continue to support the Somali government, which was formed in Nairobi in 2004, and called for regional states to help it stabilize the country and with donor funding.Kenya was due to host a meeting of the U.S.-backed International Contact Group on Somalia on Friday, two days after European officials met in Brussels to push for peace talks.Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi says his forces will stay in Somalia for a few more weeks. Somali Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi said they may stay months.Both have called for foreign peacekeepers to be sent without delay. Uganda has provisionally offered a battalion and President Yoweri Museveni was due to meet Meles on Thursday.Said Djinnit, the African Union's peace and security commissioner, said a decision about a date for the deployment of the African mission -- endorsed by the United Nations before the war -- would be made soon.\"We realize the importance of prompt and urgent action so we are talking about days and weeks to take a decision,\" he said.(Additional reporting by Daud Yussuf in Garissa, Guled Mohamed in Mogadishu, Francis Kwera in Kampala, Ingrid Melander in Brussels, Marie-Louise Gumuchian and George Obulutsa in Nairobi, Paul Eckert in Washington)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-somalia-conflict-idUSL038370920070103", "sectors": [], "title": "kenya on alert as somalia fighting nears border"},
{"date": "03:59 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Giving a dynamic \nperformance has as much to do with raw talent and intellect as \nit does having a capable director and quality material. The Hollywood Reporter recently moderated a roundtable \ndiscussion with four of Hollywood's leading actors -- Ben \nAffleck (\"Hollywoodland\"), Nicole Kidman (\"Fur: An Imaginary \nPortrait of Diane Arbus\"), Edward Norton (\"The Painted Veil,\" \n\"The Illusionist\") and Forest Whitaker (\"The Last King of \nScotland\") -- asking them what informs their script choices and \nwhat, at this stage of their careers, drives them creatively.\n THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER: WHY DO YOU ACT? Nicole Kidman: I don't think it's a choice. It's all I've \never really known, the desire to do that. If you have a choice, \nmaybe you wouldn't do it because it's a struggle. It's not \nnecessarily always filled with joy. You have to delve into \nplaces in your psyche that are not comfortable. But at the same \ntime, I love the intimacy of working with the director and the \nother actors. That's probably the thing that draws me; that's \nwhere I get my high -- and when people give you feedback in \nterms of being emotionally affected by something that you did. \nAs an actor, you are a conduit -- it's not really about you, in \na strange way. Ben Affleck: I got into it fairly young, and it seemed like \nit was the only thing I really liked doing. I felt it was \nsomething I was getting better at, where I could keep learning, \nand that felt good and was really interesting. And it was a \nreal challenge. It was a challenge to get a job. It was a \nchallenge to get a chance. It was a challenge to do something \ninteresting, to get people to believe in me, to find an honesty \nin myself.\n THR: WAS THERE A SPECIFIC MOMENT WHEN YOU FELT THIS PROFESSION COULD BE FOR YOU? Affleck: I had an audition when I was 16 for (1990's) \"Men \nDon't Leave\" with Jessica Lange. It went kind of well, then I \nwent to the second audition for the director, and I only \nvaguely understood who that was. And I did this audition -- \nthis kid talking about the death of his father -- and I had a \ncomplicated relationship with my father, and I was able to \nexperience those feelings in playing that scene, which was a \nbig deal for me. I became authentically emotional, and that was \nwhen I felt great about it. I felt, \"This is something that is \nwonderful for me to do.\" Then I came back for the screen test, \nand it was horrible! I did not get the job. Forest Whitaker: It is a struggle to maintain being open, \nto look inside yourself, go inside the dark rooms inside of \nyourself or the light rooms and uncover the truth. When you \nreach toward the truth, there is always some sort of trouble. \nThere are obstacles that obscure it when you move toward \nsomething that is honest and true. That is a struggle for me, \nat times. It is a struggle for me to feel like I am being \ncompletely honest. There was a period of time where I felt, \nevery time I looked at myself onscreen, \"This was false.\" \nInherently, it was false because it was me playing somebody \nelse. At a certain point, not so long ago, I started to figure \nout how to vibrate a little differently so that I could at \nleast trick my own mind into believing I was this other person. \nNow, I am trying to work on something different as I continue.\n THR: A DIFFERENT PROCESS? Whitaker: Yes. Because I have been through times where it \nwas painful for me -- you have no point inside of yourself \nwhere you are enjoying what is actually occurring. And I \nstarted to work on that. Edward Norton: It's a relationship that has changed a lot \nfor me over the years. The way I feel about it or am \ninteracting with it ebbs and flows; I go through very different \nphases. ... At times, it wells up in you like this compulsion, \nand at other times, (there's) that feeling acutely conscious of \nall the artifice in it. And in those moments, you need that \nlens change -- you need to do something to shake it up and get \nback into working from a more organic or less self-conscious \nplace. People think that when actors get better-known, \nself-consciousness ceases to be a factor, and I don't think \nthat's true at all. But to keep doing it, you have got to get a \nsense that you are doing it to connect with other people and \nhave other people feel connected.\n THR: DO YOU HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT THE BASIC WORTHINESS OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING? Affleck: Oh, definitely. I have a doubt about my own worth, \nand a lot of times, I experience conflict about what is the \nsocial merit of doing this. But for me, acting has been really \ntorturous. It feels like a lot of failure and very little \nsuccess, and it is hard to divorce it from what is really \nhonest and true. It has only been good when I have been able to \nput away my own vanity, my own self-consciousness, my own sense \nof how each piece of behavior that I am engaging in is going to \nbe interpreted by somebody. Kidman: I have had the same struggle as Forest. That's how \nI come up with (the idea that) you are a conduit, and it's \nprobably why I choose filmmakers that tend to be more \nphilosophical or idea people.\n THR: YOU'VE SAID IN THE PAST THAT YOU LIKE YOUR DIRECTORS TO BE PHILOSOPHER-DIRECTORS. Kidman: I make choices so spontaneously -- there is no \nrhyme or reason for it -- I just respond. I never make a plan \nfor the future; I try to just exist. But I have seen a pattern \nwith that.\n THR: WHAT MAKES A GOOD DIRECTOR? Kidman: I am not a control freak; I'll be put in the hands \nof a director and go, \"Mold me, change me.\" I love to morph and \nto change and to discover, and that's why you have to really \ncarefully pick the people.\n THR: ISN'T THAT SCARY? Kidman: Yes. But then ultimately, as much as we talk about \nacting, if you are in a film, it is about the director's \nvision. As much as you hope that what you are doing and saying \nwill be heard and remembered, there's the editing room, and the \neditor and director go and shape the performances. How many \ntimes have we seen a film and gone, \"What happened?\" I've been \nin the hands of some people I didn't respect, and that's \ntorture. If I can respect somebody, I'll walk to the ends of \nthe earth. I'm devoted. But if they do something where I'm \nlike, \"I actually don't think you're very smart or very good,\" \nthen it is, \"Oh, no.\" And if you discover that after you've \nsigned on to do it, that's a disaster.\n THR: EDWARD, IS THAT WHY YOU HAVE AT TIMES BEEN INVOLVED WITH WRITING AND EDITING, AS YOU WERE WITH (1998'S) \n\"AMERICAN HISTORY X?\" Norton: These things get talked up into more than they \nreally were. I agree fundamentally with what Nicole said. \nYou've got to respect directors' visions of things, or you \nshouldn't work with them. I would never try and have never \nfundamentally tried to steamroll somebody because it's \npointless. But I think there is a spectrum of experiences. \nThere are times when, as an actor, you come in to service \nsomebody's vision and play that role. The thing about being an \nactor that's most difficult for me is that there is this \nfundamental lack of autonomy. There is almost no other place in \nthe arts in which you can't do your work alone in your room. \nOnly actors have to wait for someone else to say, \"OK, come and \ndo it.\" And there's something in that that really messes with \nyour psychology. What's important is to learn to identify the \nway that you work -- learn to identify your own needs, learn to \nsee in others those kinds of collaborators you trust. Affleck: Part of being an actor, really, is about how \ndiscerning you are, the choices you make. The small choices you \nmake in a scene are up to you, but there is also a macro taste \nchoice -- \"How does this screenplay work? Is this director very \ngood?\" -- choices that I have made, a lot of them poorly!\n THR: WHY? Affleck: For a combination of reasons -- wanting to be \nsuccessful, wanting people to like me, wanting to make money -- \nsome of them good. You do depend on a lot of things that are \nunknown.\n THR: NICOLE, DO YOU HAVE PEOPLE YOU TURN TO FOR ADVICE WHEN YOU CHOOSE YOUR PROJECTS? Kidman: I'll pool my resources. But ultimately, you're the \none who goes through it, so you don't want to be blaming \nanybody. And I'll make choices because I want to work at a \nparticular time, because I'm running from my life! There are \nmany different ways in which you make an artistic choice, and \nsometimes they play out, sometimes they don't. What's \ninteresting to me is that when actors years ago (worked) in \nthat studio system, the idea of making a lot of movies and \ndelving into things where some of them worked and some of them \ndidn't (was wonderful). And now, there's so much judgment \nplaced on something not working that it tends to make you \nrecoil from taking chances. Norton: When you were working with Sean Penn on (2005's) \n\"The Interpreter,\" I ran into Sean and said, \"How's that \ngoing?\" And he went, \"It's fantastic. She's making me realize \nsomething about myself: I am so precious about the where and \nwhy I do something, and she is just a professional. She is so \ncommitted to working.\" When this was even more of an industry, \nin some sense, people just went to work.\n THR: BUT WAS THE WORK BETTER? Affleck: I've heard this argument made that when the \nstudios ran Hollywood, they made better movies, and when the \nactors ran Hollywood and they picked the movies, the movies \nweren't as good. I don't know that that's true. They made more \nmovies.\n THR: WHY ARE SO MANY STARS NOT TAKING RISKS NOW THAT THEY DO GET THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE? Kidman: To take risks, you have to be willing to fail. It \nis so hard to make a good film -- that is just a given -- so \nyou are already starting off (with things against you). And you \nsay, \"Well, the script may not be there, but maybe this \ndirector will find it. Am I willing to gamble on that? Yes.\" \nBut after it doesn't work a few times, you get rapped on the \nknuckles for it. And then you've got to have a film come out \nthat makes a lot of money so that you can buy yourself four or \nfive things, and then if you get lucky, maybe one of those \nrisky choices suddenly is extraordinary.\n THR: GOING BACK TO WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT KNOWING YOUR NEEDS, EDWARD, WHAT DID YOU MEAN? Norton: I guess I meant fostering good collaboration with \npeople, in terms of the environment of the work.\n THR: WHAT ARE YOUR NEEDS, FOREST? Whitaker: I am trying to grow. I am trying to become a \nbetter artist and a better person. So, I am looking to work on \nsomething that is going to push me to understand more about \nmyself and others. If I go into a project, I do hope I can find \nan environment of trust, an environment where I don't have to \nwonder, when I ask someone if that was OK, if they are telling \nme the truth or whether they are really saying, \"We need to \nmove on.\" I do have certain needs in that. You have a director \nwho is leading the environment, and hopefully you trust him \nenough to maybe even make it a Eucharistic experience, where he \ngives you something that you take in, and (something better) \ncomes out.\n THR: YOU SAID YOU WANT TO BE A BETTER ARTIST AND A BETTER HUMAN BEING. ARE THEY CONNECTED? Whitaker: I think so. A lot of our time is spent doing our \nwork, and if our work doesn't allow us to grow as people, then \nwe are lost. Norton: The best part of the whole gig is this continual \nlearning process. The most amazing privilege of the gig is that \nit is like a skeleton key into these rooms of experience. It is \na license to investigate.\n THR: ARE GREAT ARTISTS NECESSARILY GREAT HUMAN BEINGS? Affleck: I really want to believe that is true, maybe \nbecause it will make me believe this is a meritocracy. Norton: Keep on believing! (Laughter) Affleck: But I haven't found that it is true. Everybody \nhated (William Butler) Yeats, right? And yet, he is a brilliant \npoet. (In the film industry), there is a lot of ego and a lot \nof competition and a finite amount of space, and that makes \npeople a little bit more cutthroat. And there are attributes of \nthe artist that sometimes don't make them particularly pleasant \npeople. Kidman: There's a lot of fear. When the stakes are so high, \nthere's fear. But I have worked with what are probably \nconsidered some of the most \"difficult\" (people), between Lars \nvon Trier and (Stanley) Kubrick. I didn't find them difficult.\n THR: NOT EVEN VON TRIER? Kidman: No, I didn't find him difficult. I found him honest \nand raw.\n THR: BUT YOU DIDN'T DO THE SEQUEL TO (2004'S) \"DOGVILLE?\" Kidman: I didn't do the sequel because I didn't want to go \nto a place that he was asking me to go to. But I would work \nwith Lars again, and I have just been e-mailing him about \nsomething else recently. But artists are complicated. They are \nbeautiful, and they are difficult, and they can be awful. At \nthe same time, if someone is obsessed in the right way, then I \ncan forgive them a lot. \"Difficult\" is someone that doesn't \ncare, who is actually only there for the money or isn't \nobsessed with what they are trying to achieve and therefore is \na fraud. If they are actually trying to achieve something and \nreach high, then I think, good on you. Whatever the \ncomplications that go into getting there, I'll walk the walk \nwith you. Affleck: \"Difficult\" is oftentimes the mark that somebody \nis working hard and cares. That is not being a \"bad\" person. \nManipulative, dishonest, venal, ugly, hateful, petty, abusive \n-- those are also characteristics sometimes that overlap with \ngreat art. It is an easy equation when you have somebody who is \nkilling themselves and wants to push the hell out of you. I \nwish I found that more. Norton: Talent and character aren't the same thing. I don't \nthink by any estimation those things are automatically equated. \nI remember reading where Woody Allen said that he appreciated \ntalent, but he admired courage. I agree with that. There's \nplenty of people (with whom) I have had intimations that they \nare not a person of stellar character, but they are hugely \ntalented.\n THR: WHAT MAKES A GREAT ACTOR -- NOT A GOOD ONE, A GREAT ONE? Whitaker: Someone who tries to commit, tries to connect and \nis willing to give and live in that space and reach for the \ntruth. Norton: Stella Adler said (that) an actor's talent is in \ntheir choices -- not just within the material, but of the \nmaterial. When I look at actors whose body of work is really \nmeaningful to me, it is people who have succeeded on both those \ncounts: The work they do is stellar -- it is truthful, it is \ninspired -- and the choices they make within the material are \ngreat. Sometimes, it is about people who have somehow taken the \nmeasure of the times they are living in, who have connected to \nthe energy of their generation and, like Nicole said, been a \nconduit for things that were going on.\n THR: SO, NATURALISM AND BELIEVABILITY AREN'T ENOUGH? Norton: Naturalism sometimes is overrated. Naturalism can \nbe banal. Stanley Kowalski is not a naturalistic character but \na heightened character; Faye Dunaway in (1976's) \"Network\" is \nnot naturalistic. Sometimes, what a good actor is doing is \nreaching up and taking things and coalescing them into \nsomething that is like a heightened state. Kidman: Kubrick used to always say that. He would say, \n\"That's great. Now, I am not interested in 'Let's go to the \nActors Studio and watch you do a scene, and I'll believe it.' I \nam not interested in that. I want to elevate it.\" He would \nnever say what he wanted, though. Affleck: Sydney Pollack told me a story about that movie \n(1999's \"Eyes Wide Shut\"), where he said that he had a really \nhard time, and Kubrick told him, \"Real is good; interesting is \nbetter.\"\n THR: HOW IMPORTANT IS INTELLECT IN ACTING? Norton: I see people romanticizing the idea of the \n\"intuitive actor,\" as though an actor showing up and doing \nnothing but working from the guts and splattering it all over \neverywhere is the primo way to work. It is a bad projection of \na certain Jimmy Dean romanticization. The truth is, I have \nnever worked with anyone I would call a really good actor who I \ndon't think begins with an intellectual process of assessing \n(the work). ... You have got to look at the piece that you are \ngoing to service and understand its terms. An actor today can \nbe called on to do such a wide range of work -- how can you \never just apply your intuition? You have to examine the style. \nYou have to examine theme. You have to bring an intellectual \ncomponent to the work. There is a huge amount of clinical work. Kidman: It is like you are trying to map out the psychology \nof, one, a person and two, an overall story, and you've got to \nfight for moments and ideas that you think will shape it. And \nultimately, a director loves that. You want to be surprised -- \nas a director, as an actor. So much of it is, \"Come in, \nsurprise me.\" Things are discussed, and you go away, and they \nsit with you. But at the same time, what's very disturbing is \nif you work with someone who can sit at the table and talk the \ncharacter -- \"I am going to do this and this\" -- there can be a \nlot of talk. I much prefer to go, \"Let's try it. Why not?\" You \ncan get bogged down in all the ideas and talk. Affleck: That can exist without talent -- the ability to \ndiscuss something intelligently. But the ability to execute \ndoes not exist without the capacity for analyzing it. Whitaker: You are mapping out a character; you are figuring \nout how he thinks, how he feels, what he looks like, what way \nhe behaves toward this person or that person. There has to be a \nprocess of analyzing the script and then hopefully making it \norganic. And sometimes, that means talking with the director \nabout something that may be missing in the script. Kidman: I remember with (2001's) \"The Others,\" I read the \nscript and thought, \"Great.\" Then I went and did (2001's) \n\"Moulin Rouge\" and went back and read the script, and there had \nbeen a rewrite on it, and I thought, \"This isn't the film I \nwanted to make.\" So then, I arrived in Spain and in this \nscript, I am hitting a child -- and I saw this film as being \nabout a mother's love for her children, not her desire to kill \nthe children. And there was conflict for about two weeks \nbetween us (Kidman and director Alejandro Amenabar), and we \nended up with a great experience together. (Later) he said, \"I \nam so glad you fought for that.\" But I had to learn that. \nThat's where my ex-husband actually so helped me. He'd be like, \n\"Nic, go in and voice your concerns. Trust me, it will be \nappreciated.\" That's a hard thing for me, sometimes.\n THR: TO WHAT EXTENT ARE YOU MORALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT A PROJECT SAYS? Whitaker: I think you are. Norton: You make a choice to do something like put an \n18-inch swastika on your chest -- I don't do that without a \nvery careful consideration of what (the film) has to say. I am \nnot going to do that casually, and nobody should. And I am not \ndoing that film to have it say the opposite of what I think it \nwas meant to say. Affleck: That's a pretty extreme example, though. What's \nthorny is where it becomes more muddled and a little bit more \nnuanced. Kidman: I agree, in general. But I had an experience on \n\"Dogville\" where I was chosen because of my belief for the \ncharacter. I have a strong spiritual-religious part, I suppose, \nand Lars von Trier knew that and chose me for the role so that \nI would argue my point through the role, which was, \"Forgive \nothers.\" The way in which he manipulated me or used that to \nmake his overall statement was interesting to me, even though I \ndon't necessarily agree with his overall statement about \nhumanity. If it was something I was absolutely opposed to and \nfound worked against my own grain completely -- which the film \ndidn't -- (that would be different).\n THR: IS THERE ARE A CONFLICT BETWEEN ART AND MORALITY? Whitaker: I don't choose to excuse anything that's said in \nart as being OK (just because it is art). As much as they have \nthe right to do it, I have the right to judge it. There have \nbeen many times in history when people have been beat down and \noppressed and abused -- and art reflected that (positively). \nAnd I am not going to say that is OK.

His 6,000-volume library, the largest in North America at the time, became the basis for the Library of Congress.Ellison, elected in November, initially came under attack in the blogosphere and by at least one conservative radio commentator after he said he would use the Koran in his unofficial ceremony.Members are sworn in to the U.S. House of Representatives as a group with no Bibles or other books involved; but in a country where three out of every four people consider themselves Christians, the Bible has traditionally been used in ensuing unofficial ceremonies.These unofficial events among other things provide each member with a photo opportunity for themselves and their constituents.Rep. Virgil Goode, a Virginia Republican who represents the area where Jefferson lived, was one of those who criticized Ellison for wanting to use the Koran, calling for strict immigration policies specially crafted to keep Muslims out of the United States.The English translation of the Koran from Jefferson's collection dates to the 1750s. Jefferson sold his collection to the U.S. Congress after its library was lost when the British burned the Capitol during the War of 1812. Much of his collection was destroyed in an ensuing fire in 1851 but the Koran that Ellison will use survived, Dimunation said.Ellison, a native of Detroit, will be one of 42 blacks in the House next term.

The company, which has faced dwindling demand at its\nmall-based Hot Topic chain, said it expects to earn between 20\ncents and 22 cents per share for the quarter, down from a\nprevious view of 33 cents to 38 cents per share.

It heads one of two U.S.-led industry teams building a battle-management system as the nerve center of the multibillion-dollar shield involving systems on the ground, at sea and aloft.\"Over a period of five years, we're talking about a few hundred million dollars\" in Japanese investments, potentially in command and control systems of its own, as well as in U.S. solutions, Butt said in a teleconference with reporters.Lockheed is linking sensors, interceptors and other components to give military commanders a range of ways to cope with any missile attack. It would let them respond with everything from Patriot Advanced Capability-3 batteries to Aegis cruisers to ground-based interceptor missiles.But when it fired short-, intermediate- and long-range missiles starting in July, North Korea demonstrated it was able to attack the emerging shield's \"seams,\" Butt said.\"So for example, if all the systems in the Sea of Japan were focused on shots that may be heading for say South Korea ... you may miss intermediate launches going to Hawaii, or possibly something going into Japan,\" he said.Butt said talks aimed at plugging such gaps had taken place last month and were scheduled to resume this month, involving U.S. political and military officials.

(PFE.N) and sold under\nthe brand Dostinex, had a sharply higher risk of heart valve\ndamage than those taking other therapies, the studies said. The studies, one of which analyzed the records of 11,417\npatients in Britain and one of which tested 245 patients in\nItaly, reinforce the results of earlier, smaller studies\nshowing that drugs which activate a cellular receptor known as\n5-HT2b can cause damage to the heart valve, a serious condition\nthat can lead to heart failure and sudden death. \"We recommend that physicians not prescribe drugs that have\nthis biochemical property,\" said Bryan Roth, a researcher at\nthe University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who was not\ninvolved in the trials but viewed the data and commented on it\nin The New England Journal of Medicine, where both studies\nappeared. Such drugs also include the migraine headache drug\nergotamine and the amphetamine derivative known as \"ecstasy.\" Roth said his team, in a separate piece of research that\nhas yet to be published or reviewed by the scientific\ncommunity, has identified several other big-selling drugs that\nhave until now not been known to activate the 5-HT2b receptor. He declined to reveal the names of the drugs until the\nresearch has been published. \"We recommend that every drug be screened at this receptor\nbefore it goes into humans,\" Roth told Reuters in an interview.\n\"It costs just pennies per drug for such a screen.\" The British study showed that patients taking pergolide\nwere 7.1 times more likely to develop heart valve damage than\nthose who took other treatments. Patients taking the highest\ndoses of the drug had a 37 times greater risk. The study showed that patients taking cabergoline were 4.9\ntimes more likely to develop heart valve damage. At higher\ndoses patients were 50.3 times more likely to suffer damage. Both drugs are available in generic form. A second study, conducted in Italy, tested 245 people, of\nwhom 155 had Parkinson's disease. Of the diseased population,\none group received pergolide, one group received cabergoline,\nand one group received an alternative Parkinson's treatment.\nThe non-diseased control group received nothing. The results showed that 23.4 percent of patients taking\npergolide and 28.6 percent of patients taking cabergoline\nsuffered heart damage, compared to just 5.6 percent in the\ncontrol group. \"These are huge risks,\" said Roth. He said they were\nsimilar to the kind of damage seen with fen-phen, whose main\ningredients were withdrawn in 1997 and forced the drug-maker\nWyeth WYE.N to take more than $21 billion in charges to cover\nliabilities. Wyeth's recalled drugs were fenfluramine, or Pondimin, and\ndexfenfluramine, or Redux. To make fen-phen, one or the other\nwas combined with another drug called phentermine that is still\nsold by other companies. Wyeth, then called American Home Products, recalled\nPondimin and Redux after some of the 6 million Americans who\nhad taken fen-phen developed heart-valve problems. Roth said pergolide is also used to treat restless leg\nsyndrome, a condition in which patients feel a crawling\nsensation in their legs combined with a need to move them.

The Getty museum is the richest U.S. art institution, with an endowment of over $5 billion, and one of the world's leading repositories of antiquities.Current Getty director Michael Brand has said the museum was willing to return 26 of 46 disputed pieces that Italy wants back, including the Aphrodite, pending a final check on its provenance.According to the Times, signs the Aphrodite statue was looted included fractures, dirt smudges that suggested smuggling and the dealer's assertion the piece came from a Swiss collector whose family had it since 1939 -- the same year it became illegal to export Italian antiquities.\"Any museum professional looking at an archeological piece in those conditions had to suspect it came from an illicit origin,\" said Luis Monreal, former director of the Getty Conservation Institute.Monreal said he had warned John Walsh, at the time the museum's director, not to buy the statue and even suggested a test of pollen in the dirt would indicate the statue's origin. The test was never done, the Times reported.The Getty Trust, which controls the museum and was founded by oil billionaire J. Paul Getty, has been under intense scrutiny for the past two years as Italian and Greek authorities have accused the museum of possessing looted antiquities.A former curator has been charged with art theft and a Trust chairman resigned in 2006 following controversies over art looting.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-getty-aphrodite-idUSN0340729020070103", "sectors": [["U.S., ", "Entertainment"]], "title": "getty officials knew famous statue looted : paper"},

Molnar from University of Ottawa told Reuters Health.\"There appears to be an unintentional gap between the analytic approaches that driving researchers are comfortable using and have been trained to do (e.g., multivariate analysis) and the needs of clinicians for short, rapidly interpretable assessment tools that the researchers' analytic approaches will never yield.\"Molnar and colleagues performed a comprehensive search of published studies in an effort to review evidence regarding in-office cognitive tests that might identify dementia patients who can drive safely and those who cannot.They found 16 studies that met their inclusion criteria, including six that used history of crash, four that used driving simulator test results, and six that used on-road assessments as measures of driving safety.None of the studies reported cutoff scores, which is a real problem, the investigators explain. The researchers also found a great deal of inconsistency between the test results and driving outcome measures.In his practice, Molnar said he uses screening tests recommended by medical associations like the American Medical Association and the Canadian Medical Association and then asks himself if he would want to be a passenger if this person was driving.Next, he looks for other signs that may indicate the patient is unsafe to drive. For example, if a patient has difficulty with simple activities, such as shopping, banking, cooking or hobbies, there is cause for concern.\"If the person has dementia and I feel they are still safe to drive for a short period, I advise them to start planning for driving cessation in the future and then decide when I should retest them,\" Molnar continued.\"Generally, 6 months is felt to be the upper limit of time for reevaluation.\"\"I advise family members to call me immediately if there are any concerning signs of significant cognitive change,\" he continued. When it is still not clear if a person is safe to drive, Molnar refers then for specialized testing.SOURCE: Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, December 2006", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-health-dementia-idUSTON37965320070103", "sectors": [["Health"]], "title": "identifying safe drivers with dementia not easy , study says"},

{"date": "17:16 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " By Cameron French TORONTO, Jan 3 The Canadian dollar plunged to\nnine-month lows against the U.S. currency on Wednesday, felled\nby sliding oil prices and a broadly rallying greenback. Domestic bond prices edged higher, as concerns about U.S.\ngrowth sent a mild charge into North American debt prices. The currency finished at C$1.1723  or 85.30 U.S. cents,\ndown from C$1.1636 to the U.S. dollar, or 85.94 U.S. cents, at\nTuesday's close. Crude oil prices fell nearly $3 per barrel as unseasonably\nwarm weather in the U.S. Northeast kept consumption low,\nputting pressure on demand for heating fuels. With Canada's trade surplus heavily reliant on oil exports,\nthe retreat put pressure on the currency, which also felt the\nsting from a broad U.S. dollar rally. The Canadian dollar dropped as far as C$1.1732, or 85.24\nU.S. cents, its lowest level since last April, falling hard\novernight and sliding at a slower pace during the daily\nsession. \"The move that we've seen today has really been a U.S.\ndollar move rather than a Canada move,\" said Jack Spitz,\ndirector of foreign exchange at National Bank Financial. \"I think it's more of a reflection of risk being taken off\nthe table ahead of Friday's nonfarm payroll, rather than a\nfeeling that the U.S. dollar is going to catch a longer term\nbid.\" Canada will also release December jobs data on Friday, and\nanalysts will be looking for signs the economy has not slowed\nsignificantly. The greenback got a bit of a boost after the U.S. Institute\nfor Supply Management said its manufacturing index climbed to\n52.4 from 49.5 in November. But the U.S. currency pared gains\nin the afternoon after the release of the minutes from the U.S.\nFederal Reserve's December policy meeting. Spitz said the overall direction for the Canadian dollar is\nto weaken, but said the its recent sharp fall suggests it may\nbe due for a short-term retracement of its losses. He noted\nthat International Monetary Market futures showed record levels\nof betting against the Canadian dollar. \"I think that's seen as extreme and we could be in store\nfor a (U.S. dollar) pullback, certainly if Friday's payroll\ndata in Canada surprises to the upside,\" he said. BONDS EDGE HIGHER Canadian bond prices strengthened slightly, continuing to\nunwind last week's losses and drawn higher by U.S. treasuries,\nwhich were helped by the Fed minutes. The Fed expressed concern over potentially slower growth,\naccording to the minutes of its last meeting, slightly raising\nexpectations of an interest rate cut later this year. The Bank of Canada is also expected to ease rates, but\nanalysts are split on when it will happen. The central bank\nmakes its next announcement on Jan. 16, but it is expected to\nleave rates steady. Thursday's trading could take its cue in part from the\nrelease of November producer prices and raw materials prices. The two-year bond climbed 3 Canadian cents to C$100.49 to\nyield 3.982 percent, while the 10-year bond rose 12 Canadian\ncents to C$99.66 to yield 4.043 percent. The yield spread between the two-year and 10-year bond\nmoved to 6.1 basis points from 6.0 at the previous close. The 30-year bond rose 30 Canadian cents to C$126.45 to\nyield 4.100 percent.

The\nU.S. current account shortfall ballooned to an estimated $869\nbillion in 2006, from about $472 billion in 2002, according to\nNY Fed estimates. The NY Fed study also indicated that most petrodollar\ninvestments found their way into the United States indirectly,\nas countries like Japan, which had received investments from\noil exporters, funneled such inflows back to the United States\nthrough the purchase of U.S. securities. On the trade side, oil exporters purchased more goods and\nservices from the euro zone and China, which offset both\nregions' crude oil imports, the study said. The euro zone's oil imports more than doubled between\n2002-2006, rising roughly by $192 billion to $316 billion, but\nthe region's exports to oil-producing nations climbed $77\nbillion to hit $167 billion. All told, the NY Fed analysts said\n41 U.S. cents of each $1 of oil imports came back to the euro\nzone in the form of higher purchases of euro zone goods.  Euro zone exports to oil-producing countries were higher\nbecause of geographic proximity, the analysts said. Europe is\ncloser than the United States to the major oil exporters of the\nMiddle East, and two large oil exporters -- Norway and Russia\n-- are in Europe itself. In the case of China, 60 cents of each $1 in oil purchases\nsent overseas returned to purchase Chinese goods. \"This high figure accords with the explosive growth of\nChina's exports to all markets. ... Given China's gains in\nmarket share, the country might well have seen its sales to oil\nexporters climb sharply, even if oil exporters' purchases\nworldwide had remained flat in recent years,\" the NY Fed\nanalysts said. By contrast, just 20 cents of each $1 imported by the\nUnited States came back for the purchase of American goods.\n\n\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/economy-usa-oil-idUSN0343612720070103", "sectors": [["Bonds"]], "title": "us single biggest recipient of petrodollars - study"},

{"date": "17:30 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "BAGHDAD U.S. forces had no role in Saddam Hussein's hanging, but would have handled it differently, a U.S. general said on Wednesday as Iraqi authorities questioned a guard over a video of officials taunting Saddam on the gallows.National Security Adviser Mowaffaq al-Rubaie said a committee investigating who had illicitly filmed and leaked a video of the hanging was questioning one of the guards at the prison facility where Saddam was hanged at dawn on Saturday.There were conflicting reports of whether Saddam's two co- defendants, including his half-brother Barzan, would be hanged on Thursday at dawn. Rubaie said the date had not been set.The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour appealed to Iraq not to execute the two men.As the White House said President George W. Bush had not seen the Saddam video, Major General William Caldwell urged the Iraqi government to reach out to disillusioned Sunni Arabs, who have warned that the execution and film are blows to the Shi'ite-led government's efforts at national reconciliation.Caldwell said U.S. forces, who had physical custody of Saddam for three years, left all security measures at Saddam's hanging, including access to the execution chamber, to Iraqis.\"Had we been physically in charge at that point we would have done things differently,\" Caldwell told a news conference.\"At this point the government of Iraq has the opportunity to take advantage of what has occurred and really reach out now in an attempt to bring more people back into the political process and bring the Sunnis back,\" he said, singling out a need to ease restrictions on former members of Saddam's Baath party.\"It's a real critical juncture.\"In unusually direct advice from the U.S. military to Iraqi leaders, Caldwell said the country's government and parliament \"will have to rise above past divisions\".\"This will entail difficult decisions ... and hard compromises necessary for national reconciliation.\"VIDEO STIRS ANGERCaldwell said there had been a lull in violence over the Eid al-Adha holiday which started on Saturday, but U.S. forces were braced for a possible violent backlash still to come.Thousands of Saddam's fellow Sunni Arabs have marched to vent anger at the execution in Sunni Arab strongholds. More mourners came to visit his grave in his home village of Awja on Wednesday, and other towns also saw further demonstrations.The unofficial video of the hanging, apparently filmed on a mobile phone, showed Shi'ite officials mocking Saddam just before he was hanged, inflaming sectarian passions in a country already on the brink of sectarian civil war.Rubaie blamed the video on people trying to raise tension.\"Whoever leaked this video meant to harm national reconciliation and drive a wedge between Shi'ites and Sunnis,\" said Rubaie, one of some 20 official witnesses at the hanging.Sadiq al-Rikabi, an adviser to the prime minister, told Iraqiya state television that a number of guards at the facility had been taken in for questioning and investigators had identified a person suspected of filming the hanging.Prosecutor Munkith al-Faroon, heard appealing for order on the video, told Reuters on Tuesday that two senior officials had filmed the hanging, challenging government claims guards did it.TIMINGThe timing of the execution, just four days after an appeal failed and on the first day of Eid, shocked many, both in Iraq and in the rest of the Muslim world.A senior U.S. official told the New York Times Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki was concerned that if Saddam was not hanged quickly he would somehow escape the noose.\"His concern was security, and that ... maybe there would be a mass kidnapping to bargain for Saddam Hussein's release,\" he said. \"He was concerned that he might somehow get free.\"Rubaie confirmed that Iraqi officials had been concerned Saddam might escape justice: \"The question is not 'Why the rush in the execution?' The question is 'Why the delay?'\"Some people were talking about the Americans, saying they might take him to one of these islands controlled by the United States and exile him there.\"Rubaie, Faroon and Sami al-Askari, a senior aide to Maliki, all said the date had not been set for the hanging of Barzan al -Tikriti, Saddam's half brother and former intelligence chief, and Awad al-Bander, a former chief judge, despite other officials telling media they would hang on Thursday at dawn.U.N. rights chief Arbour called for clemency.\"International law, as it currently stands, only allows the imposition of the death penalty as an exceptional measure within rigorous legal constraints,\" she said.At the United Nations in New York, a spokeswoman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the U.N. leader was \"strongly behind\" and \"fully endorses\" Arbour's statement.(Additional reporting by Aseel Kami, Ibon Villelabeitia and Alastair Macdonald in Baghdad, Robert Evans in Geneva and Evelyn Leopold at the United Nations)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-iraq-idUSL30803120070103", "sectors": [], "title": "u . s . on saddam : would have done it differently"},

Without a declaration of parentage or some other order, the surviving partner would be unable to make decisions for their minor child.\"The two women, who have been together since 1990, told the court they did not want to adopt the child because it meant the father would lose his status as a parent.\"It's an important precedent because the legislature has not kept the legislation up to date,\" said Peter Jervis, one of the lawyers for the applicant, referred to only as \"A.A.\"\"The court has basically said that it would step in to recognize this woman as the mother of her child ... and would treat her equally,\" said Jervis.He added that the court found the family to be a very loving one and that A.A. had met all the criteria of being a loving mother.\"She read the bedtime stories, put the Band-Aids on his fingers, cleaned his runny nose, had taken him off to school,\" said Jervis.The Alliance for Marriage and Family, a coalition of several groups that promote a traditional family structure, had filed as an intervenor in the case.\"We think there are many good reasons for continuing to uphold the definition of family as two parents,\" said Joanne McGarry, executive director of the Catholic Civil Rights League, one of the groups represented by the alliance.\"Once you remove it from the realm of nature and the realm of traditional moral and religious teachings, who's going to decide how many parents a child can have?

The Fed's concern over potentially slower growth helped\nboost investor expectations the central bank may cut interest\nrates in 2007, boosting U.S. Treasury debt prices and U.S. rate\nfutures. Stocks reversed gains and ended little changed on the\nday, and the dollar also pared gains but was up on the day. \"The biggest change is that they are showing a little more\nanxiety about the economy,\" said Sam Rahman, a portfolio\nmanager for Baring Asset Management Inc., in Boston. \"While inflation remains a key focus, the FOMC is showing\nclearer signs that the weakening economic environment has\nraised concerns,\" he said. The U.S. central bank at the Dec 12 meeting held benchmark\ninterest rates steady at 5.25 percent, renewing a warning on\ninflation but also nodding to \"mixed\" economic signals and a\n\"substantial\" housing slowdown. The minutes showed one member of the policy-setting\ncommittee was concerned enough about growth to favor a\nstatement saying monetary policy could be adjusted in either\ndirection. The statement the Fed issued last month said only that\nadditional firming -- increases in interest rates -- might be\nnecessary to address risks from inflation. Participants in the Federal Open Market Committee meeting\nsaid the slowdown in the housing sector continued to weigh\nheavily on economic activity in the United States. Although\nthere was evidence that home sales might be stabilizing,\nresidential investment was likely to fall further in coming\nquarters as builders reduced inventories, officials felt. The housing slowdown has not spilled over significantly\ninto consumer spending, but \"considerable uncertainty\"\nsurrounding housing activity meant its impact on spending could\neventually become more evident, especially if house prices\ndecline significantly, officials said. At the same time, central bank officials said a slowdown in\nbusiness investment and production, along with high inventories\nfor automobiles and in other sectors, added to a picture of\nslowing economic expansion. However, economic data released since then has pointed to\nresilience in the economy. Consumer confidence was at its highest level in December in\neight months, existing homes sales rose in November for the\nsecond month in a row, and Chicago purchasing managers snapped\nback into expansion mode in the last month of the year, reports\nreleased at the end of December showed. All of the participants in the meeting remained concerned\nabout inflation, the minutes said. \"Although readings on core inflation had improved modestly\nsince the spring, nearly all participants viewed core inflation\nas uncomfortably high and stressed the importance of further\nmoderation,\" the minutes said. The FOMC saw \"considerable uncertainty\" regarding how much\nand how fast core inflation would recede and believed that the\nrisks around the desired downward path remained to the upside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/usa-fed-minutes-idUSN0340865420070103", "sectors": [["Bonds"]], "title": "update 3 - some at fed saw increased risks to growth - minutes"},

{"date": "17:20 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "CHICAGO Jan 3 Many option investors appear to\nbe betting on a big move in the shares of an energy fund in\nwhat can be called a volatility play after a 4 percent drop in\ncrude oil prices, traders said on Wednesday. Shares of energy companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp.\n(XOM.N) were a big drag on the Standard & Poor's 500 Index\n.SPX as U.S. crude oil for February delivery CLG7 fell\n$2.73 to settle at $58.32 a barrel. Oil prices headed south during this first day of trading\nin 2007 due to mild winter weather in the U.S. Northeast,\nwhich cut demand for fuel in the world's biggest heating oil\nmarket. The slide in crude oil prices prompted many market\nparticipants to focus on both the puts and calls pegged to the\nshares of the Energy Select Sector SPDR fund (XLE.A)(XLE.N),\nwhere roughly 180,800 contracts -- dominated by 143,897 puts\n-- traded late on the day. The exchange traded fund, down 3.86 percent at $56.48, is\none of the most active of the SPDR sector funds, tracking the\nenergy-related stocks from within the benchmark S&P 500\nindex. \"Both puts and calls were active in the XLE due to the\nfact that people are speculating that oil prices are going to\nfluctuate over the near-term,\" said William Lefkowitz, options\nstrategist at brokerage firm vFinance Investments in New\nYork. In a volatility play, investors who expect\ngreater-than-anticipated stock moves will buy puts or calls\nthat they deem to be underpriced and will rise in value due to\na stock swing in either direction. A LITTLE SOUTHERN EXPOSURE Some investors have turned to puts in the fund, betting\nthat oil prices are heading down as the weather in the\nNortheast has been unusually warm and continued to stay that\nway this week, Lefkowitz said. But other players were looking at upside XLE calls,\nspeculating that oil prices will rebound quickly as they have\ndone many times in the past, Lefkowitz added. Susquehanna Financial Group chief options analyst Stacey\nBriere Gilbert also noted that volatility option buyers\ndominated order flow in the fund during the session. She noticed investors were mostly buying puts with strike\nprices of $54, $57 and $59 in January, February and March.\nPlayers also were purchasing calls that grant them the right\nto buy the fund at $58 and $61 by mid-January. The flurry of option interest was also accompanied by a\nrise in the fund's option projected volatility -- a\nstatistical measure related to how much a security is expected\nto move up or down based on near-term option prices. \"At-the-money volatility is up approximately 2 points in\neach of the front three months,\" Briere Gilbert said.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/energy-options-spdr-idUSN0342387920070103", "sectors": [], "title": "energy etf options draw interest in volatility play"},

{"date": "17:46 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " (Adds Reid comments) By Steve HollandWASHINGTON Jan 3 (Reuters) - With Democrats poised to take\nover Congress, President George W. Bush on Wednesday used a\nRose Garden ceremony and a newspaper opinion piece to push for\nspending cuts and rally support for an Iraq policy he has yet\nto announce. Speaking at a ceremony after a Cabinet meeting, Bush used\nthe White House stage to announce a proposal to balance the\nU.S. budget by 2012. He also wrote a rare opinion article in\nThe Wall Street Journal promoting his new strategy for Iraq to\nbe announced in coming days. Bush called upon Democrats to set aside politics, but\nDemocrats, who are preparing to flex their muscle with a\nlegislative push when they take command of Congress on\nThursday, responded cautiously. \"We hope that when the president says compromise, it means\nmore than 'do it my way,' which is what he's meant in the\npast,\" said New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer. \"I'm encouraged that President Bush said today that he\nwants to work in bipartisanship, and I hope he means it,\" said\nincoming Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. In his White House comments, Bush said he would present a\nfive-year plan to Congress next month that would balance the\nbudget by 2012 -- three years after his presidency ends -- and\nmake lower tax rates permanent. Bush called on Congress to reform the process in which\nbillions of dollars in individual spending items, known as\n\"earmarks,\" for specific congressional districts are able to\nget approved without a vote. Balancing the budget in that time frame would require\nsubstantial spending discipline, given that recent projections\nby the White House showed it expected a budget gap of $127\nbillion by 2011. In early February, Congress expects Bush to request about\n$100 billion in additional \"emergency\" funds to pay for combat\nin Iraq and Afghanistan. The wars currently are being funded\nwith $70 billion put into the pipeline a few months ago. \"We welcome the president's newfound commitment to a\nbalanced budget, but his comments make us wary,\" said incoming\nHouse Budget Committee Chairman John Spratt of South Carolina.\n\"They suggest that his budget will still embody the policies\nthat led to the largest deficits in history.\" Bush also wrote in a rare opinion article in The Wall\nStreet Journal on Wednesday that his new strategy for Iraq\nwould help the \"people gain control of the security situation\nand hasten the day when the Iraqi government gains full control\nover its affairs.\" \"We now have the opportunity to build a bipartisan\nconsensus to fight and win the war,\" he wrote. NEW IRAQ STRATEGY Bush is to announce a new strategy for Iraq as early as\nTuesday and he is considering a short-term increase of\nthousands of U.S. troops to try to bring stability to Baghdad. The White House described him as \"narrowing the choices\"\nand said he was focusing on a package of options that included\n\"the military front, the economic front and the political\nfront\" to announce as a whole. Bush has two years left in office and believes he can\naccomplish some of his legislative agenda, even though his\nRepublican Party has lost control of the House of\nRepresentatives and the Senate and Americans are increasingly\nturning their attention to the 2008 race to succeed him.\n (Additional reporting by Glenn Somerville, Richard Cowan and\nThomas Ferraro)\n\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/bush-cabinet-idUSN0343870720070103", "sectors": [["Bonds"]], "title": "update 1 - bush seeks backing for agenda on u . s . budget , iraq"},

{"date": "19:42 31 December 2006 (UTC)", "text": " NEW YORK (Billboard) - In the troubled music industry, flat \nsales are the new up for retailers. According to Nielsen SoundScan, album sales totaled 105.3 \nmillion for the six-week period ended December 24. That's 4.1% \ndown from 2005's total of 109.8 million. And 2005 was \nconsidered the weakest holiday selling season in memory. Still, retailers choose to see a half-full glass. Billboard \nspoke with more than 20, responsible for roughly 40% of U.S. \nsales. \"We had a good week Christmas week, and (the day after \nChristmas) was great,\" says Rob Perkins, president of 67-unit, \nMarietta, Ga.-based Value Music. \"For the overall holiday \nselling season, we made plan, which means comparable-store \nsales were slightly down.\" Music label executives may cheer the volume of purchases: \nwhen digital track, music video and singles sales are included, \nsales totaled 47.4 million units for Christmas week, according \nto SoundScan. That tops the prior best-week sales total of 46.5 \nmillion units, recorded during the Christmas week of 2000, the \nyear that U.S. album sales peaked. However, digital sales are still not offsetting declines in \nthe physical space. Using SoundScan's album equivalency of 10 \ndigital tracks sold -- generous, considering a typical album \nhas more -- this year total album sales equaled 111.4 million \nunits for the holiday selling period, still a 2.1% decline from \nlast year's equivalent total of 113.8 million. Varying from merchant to merchant, 2006 holiday selling \nseason comparable-store sales ranged from slightly down to 10% \ndown. In Brighton, Mass., Mike Dreese -- CEO of 25-store chain \nNewbury Comics -- says the holiday selling season was \"OK. \nNovember was not good, but December was pretty good.\" On a comparable-store basis, the chain's sales were down \nabout 7% during December. In Nashville, Music City VP Scott Perkins reports that in \nthe nine days leading up to Christmas, the 25-unit chain was \ndown about 10% on a comparable-store basis. \"We have seen worse \npercentages down in (comparable-store) sales,\" he says. \"We \nwill take any positive spin we can get.\" Likewise, in Omaha, Neb., Mike Fratt, GM at the six-store \nHomer's chain, reports that comparable-store holiday sales were \ndown \"high single digits.\" Fratt says, \"We couldn't tell if there were any hits, \nbecause we lost that business to the big boxes (like Target and \nBest Buy) who were all selling the top hits at $9.99 . . . \nBusiness kicked in for us about 10 days out, I guess because \nthe mass merchants ran out and were unable to reload in time.\" Joe Nardone Jr., VP at the 11-unit Gallery of Sound chain \nin Wilkes-Barre, Pa., says he saw a few hits emerge, including \nnew releases from Nas, Eminem and the Beatles. Hinder's \n\"Extreme Behavior,\" Daughtry's self-titled album and Twisted \nSister's \"Twisted Christmas\" did better than expected, he says. \nAnd right at the end of the season, according to Nardone, \nJustin Timberlake's \"FutureSex/LoveSounds\" exploded while My \nChemical Romance's \"The Black Parade\" and Akon's \"Konvicted\" \nalso picked up.\n SURPRISE SELLERS At Newbury, Dreese reported that the chain underestimated \nthe fire power of Sarah McLachlan's \"Wintersong,\" James \nTaylor's \"At Christmas\" and Tony Bennett's \"Duets: An American \nClassic.\" Other titles that did well include Young Jeezy's \"The \nInspiration,\" Beyonce's \"B'Day,\" Ciara's \"The Evolution\" and \nthe J.J. Cale & Eric Clapton album \"The Road to Escondido,\" \nValue Music's Perkins reports. One surprise this year was the superb performance of \nChristmas music. In fact, one major-label executive says, \"If \nit weren't for holiday music, everybody would be in the \ntoilet.\" Retail executives regularly cited Christmas albums by \nTaylor, McLachlan and Il Divo as showing up in their top 10 \nbest-selling albums of the season. At Starbucks in Seattle, the chain's own exclusive \"Santa \nBaby\" compilation drove music sales, Starbucks Entertainment \npresident Ken Lombard says. Issued in November, it has since \ncrossed the 250,000-unit mark, he reported just before \nChristmas. While most brick-and-mortar merchants reported sales \ndeclines, online merchants selling physical goods had a banner \nyear, according to one wholesaler who does fulfillment for such \nretailers. Indeed, Amazon claimed it had its best holiday \nselling season ever, though it declined to release specific \nnumbers. SoundScan reports that nontraditional merchants--which \ninclude catalog merchants and albums sold at concerts or \nthrough TV direct-marketing campaigns -- enjoyed a 35.5% \nincrease during the holiday.

{"date": "21:31 01 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " NEW YORK (Billboard) - Following are previews of albums due \nout within the next few months from debut acts or \nunder-the-radar artists due for a breakthrough.\n PAOLO NUTINI Scottish singer/songwriter Paolo Nutini, who turns 20 \nJanuary 9, was one of the most noteworthy breakout artists of \n2006 for Atlantic Records in the United Kingdom. After an \nappearance at South by Southwest in Austin last March, his \ndebut single, \"Last Request,\" reached No. 5 in July on the \nBritish charts and also became a substantial airplay hit. His debut album, \"These Streets,\" subsequently opened at \nNo. 3 with out-of-the-box sales of 35,000, according to his \nlabel, which had risen to 500,000 by December. A second single, \"Jenny Don't Be Hasty,\" was a top 20 U.K. \nhit in early October and was followed in early December by \n\"Rewind.\" As \"New Shoes,\" his first U.S. radio track, made inroads at \nthe triple-A format late in the year, Atlantic was developing \nits transatlantic plans for Nutini for 2007. \"These Streets\" is \ndue for U.S. release January 30, when he performs on \"Today,\" \nwith a booking for \"Late Night With Conan O'Brien\" the \nfollowing day.\n JAMES MORRISON His name may have a familiar ring for U.S. audiences. And \nby the early part of 2007, American radio listeners and record \nbuyers are expected to recognize James Morrison's music. One of the big breakout success stories in the United \nKingdom in 2006, the Polydor-signed artist is tipped for big \nthings abroad. Soundwise, think James Blunt, with an edge. Interscope is setting up the smoky-toned singer's debut \nalbum, \"Undiscovered,\" for U.S. release in first-quarter 2007, \nat which time Morrison will head Stateside to do promotional \nand support work. The album has shipped more than 1 million copies worldwide \nsince its August release, more than half of those tallied in \nthe United Kingdom.\n YOUNG LOVE Last year, Young Love -- a.k.a. Dan Keyes, former frontman \nof Texas rock band Recover -- was busing tables and working at \nAmerican Apparel in New York, casually carting a demo of \ndance-rock tunes from one hipster club to the next. DJs dug them, especially the Bloc Party-meets-Blur \n\"Discotech,\" a guitar-laden ode to boogie-ing in the Big Apple \nthat is so joyful and unpretentious that it had to be written \nby an out-of-towner. Then Jay-Z called. \"This is where it's at,\" Jay-Z told Keyes over brunch in \nMiami, as Beyonce lounged by the pool and paparazzi helicopters \ncircled. So Keyes signed with Island Def Jam and took his demos into \nthe studio. Keyes himself resembles the shaggy teen hero, fair and \nlanky with an intense gray-eyed stare. \"A friend gave me Daft \nPunk's 'Discovery' for Christmas a couple of years ago, and it \nkind of destroyed my rock band,\" he says. \"I didn't want to \nplay guitar anymore, so I started experimenting with electronic \nstuff.\"\n THE PONYS The Ponys' first full-length album on esteemed indie \nMatador Records doesn't arrive until March 20. But judging from the Chicago-based rock band's previous \nwork, its Matador debut, \"Turn the Lights Out,\" should be worth \nthe wait. The act's 2005 disc, \"Celebration Castle,\" released on Los \nAngeles-based garage rock label In the Red, has sold 7,000 \nunits in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. \"Celebration Castle\" matched a hard-rock intensity with a \nhung-over swagger, and the Ponys established themselves as one \nof the most exciting bands in underground rock. From the bluesy breakdown in shout-along anthem \"Get Black\" \nto the slacker wailing of frontman/guitarist Jered Gummere in \nthe punk-rock strut of \"Today,\" \"Celebration Castle\" flirted \nwith recklessness as its tightly structured songs burst with \npop hooks. The band is also confident enough to slow things down and \nshow off some new wave influences (see the Cure-like \"We Shot \nthe World\"). In the Red has given Matador a solid base to build \nupon in further boosting the Ponys' career.\n LEDISI R&B's underground cognoscenti have carried a torch for this \nspirited singer/songwriter since 1996. Folks still wax \nrhapsodic over Ledisi's \"Soulsinger,\" her 1998 indie debut, \naccompanied by former partner and keyboardist Sundra Manning. Now a solo artist, Ledisi is a rare but welcome commodity: \nWhat you hear on record is what you get live. Mixing R&B, jazz, \ngospel, pop and rock with flavorful scatting, Ledisi's \nenergetic live gigs are can't-miss propositions. Two years ago, this Oakland, Calif., talent offered an \narresting interpretation of Luther Vandross' \"My Sensitivity\" \nthat gained some national airplay, as well as the attention of \nVerve Records. Now Ledisi's sassy vocals (think Minnie Riperton meets \nSarah Vaughan) are poised to reach a wider arena this spring \nwith the release of her Verve debut. A fitting scenario, given \nthat Ledisi's name means \"to come forth\" in Nigerian. Ledisi still isn't leaving anything to chance. She \ncontinues to operate her label, LeSun Music, and owns her \nmasters.\n LUKE BRYAN Luke Bryan is unapologetically country in his music and \nlifestyle, which is why he stands out from the pack. \"Even my friends in Nashville laugh sometimes at how \ncountry I am,\" he says. \"I'm still adjusting to (living in \nNashville) because I can't . . . just walk out my door and go \nfishing or hunting or do something outdoors.\" A native of Leesburg, Ga., Bryan grew up on his family's \npeanut farm. With lyrics like \"I can grow my own groceries and salt-cure \na ham/Hey baby, I'm a country man\" and a stone-country \npresentation, Bryan is hatched from the same mold as Randy \nTravis and Alan Jackson. First single \"All My Friends Say\" is due at radio in \nFebruary, and an album will follow in summer. Bryan co-wrote \nall 11 songs on his Capitol Records Nashville debut and also \nco-wrote Billy Currington's current single \"Good Directions.\" In an effort to build consumer awareness, Capitol made a \nfour-song EP and individual tracks available on iTunes in late \nOctober.\n NAOMI STRIEMER Fans of purely melodic pop music should rejoice. Naomi \nStriemer is here to offer what they crave. The singer/songwriter, whose debut album \"Images\" arrived \nin December on S Records, was home-schooled in her native Nova \nScotia, Canada, but she realized she had a purpose far from the \nfarm. \"Thinking back to where I come from and enjoying the \ninnocence of life's untouched imagination, I dreamt of being \nsomething that seemed so far out of reach but so close in my \nmind,\" Striemer says. As a teen, she signed with Epic Records, but the deal \nunraveled when then-president Polly Anthony exited. Then Steven Nowack, a hedge-fund driver, saw Striemer \nperform live in Toronto, and approached the artist and asked, \n\"What are you doing for the rest of your life?\" He formed S \nRecords as a vehicle to launch her. Her album's first single, the melancholy ballad \"Cars,\" \nproduced by Narada Michael Walden and featuring a guitar solo \nby Carlos Santana, gained coverage from Fox News columnist \nRoger Friedman and the National Post in Canada. \"I am a testament that it doesn't matter where you come \nfrom or how badly the world tears you down,\" Striemer says. \"If \nyou believe, life, love and God will get you through.\"\n JOHN WALLER When one of country music's veteran hitmakers and one of \nthe Christian community's most successful artists team up to \nintroduce a new act, expectations run high. And \nsinger/songwriter John Waller meets and exceeds those \nexpectations with thoughtful songwriting and a compelling \nvoice. The former frontman for acclaimed indie band According to \nJohn, Waller returns on Beach Street Records, a Christian label \nowned by Sawyer Brown's Mark Miller. Mark Hall, leader of Beach \nStreet's flagship act Casting Crowns, introduced Miller to \nWaller's music. Hall met Waller at a youth rally shortly after \nSeptember 11, 2001, and recalls being immediately impressed \nwith Waller's songwriting. \"Then he started talking between the songs, and something \nstood out about him,\" Hall says. \"I could tell he was reaching \nmy students.\" After his earlier band broke up, Waller moved to Colorado \nto become a worship pastor. During a trip to Atlanta, he \nenlisted Hall to sing on a song called \"The Blessing.\" Hall sent a CD to Miller, who signed Waller to Beach \nStreet. The label is working \"The Blessing\" at Christian radio \nas the first single from Waller's debut album, set to arrive \nMarch 6.\n K-OS Toronto-bred MC Kheaven Brereton, aka K-OS, has been making \nwaves in Canada and beyond since his 2002 debut album, \"Exit.\" \nBut he's poised to finally infiltrate the United States in 2007 \nwith \"Atlantis: Hymns for Disco,\" which will be worked here by \nVirgin. K-OS' two prior albums were released in the States by \nAstralwerks. In Canada, the genre-bending \"Atlantis\" debuted in October \nat No. 5 on the album chart, the highest debut by any Canadian \nurban artist in Nielsen SoundScan history, Virgin says. In the States, the album's first single is the infectious \n\"Sunday Morning,\" which many are likening to OutKast's \"Hey \nYa!\" or Gnarls Barkley's \"Crazy.\" Ahead of the album's February 20 U.S. release, \"Sunday \nMorning\" is already benefiting from airplay at NASCAR, NFL and \nNCAA events and on ESPN's \"NFL Sunday Morning Countdown.\"\n RICH BOY Rich Boy, a.k.a. Maurice Richards, is catching everyone's \nears with his single \"Throw Some D's,\" which samples Switch's \n\"I Call Your Name.\" Working with producers Butta and Polow Da Don (known for \ntheir tracks with the Pussycat Dolls and Fergie of the Black \nEyed Peas), Rich Boy is cooking up debut album \"A Product of \nthe Hustle\" for release early this year. A native of Mobile, Ala., Rich Boy began as a student at \nhistorically black college Tuskegee University before he \ndropped out to pursue music. Thinking he'd make it as a producer instead of mechanical \nengineer, his original major, he wrote the track \"Cold As Ice,\" \nwhich garnered local radio support. After meeting Polow in 2003, Rich Boy later signed with \nInterscope and began his artist-development process. Now \"Throw \nSome D's\" is also garnering strong support at national radio. In addition, MTV profiled Rich on its up-and-coming artists \nseries, \"You Hear It First.\" And realizing hip-hop's high \nturnover rate, Rich Boy is rejuvenating \"Throw Some D's\" with a \nsoon-to-be-released remix featuring the Game, Jim Jones and \nOutKast's Andre 3000.

{"date": "23:40 01 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " NEW YORK (Billboard) - Sick of the music scene in New York \nor London? It may be time to savor the delights of five \nunlikely cities spawning exciting new sounds.\n BEIJING Population: 14 million Main Language: Mandarin Chinese Shanghai may have become China's business heart, but \nBeijing remains its political and cultural capital -- and home \nto a burgeoning modern music scene eager to reach audiences \noutside the People's Republic. In the past, domestically successful rock bands like Tang \nDynasty, Spring Autumn and AK-47 have emerged from Beijing, as \ndid the \"godfather\" of Chinese rock, Cui Jian. Now a new \ngeneration of alternative acts is appearing. \"Beijing has solidified its place as the locus of modern \nmusic on the mainland,\" says Shen Lihui, CEO of leading Beijing \nindependent label Modern Sky. The healthy live scene is also starting to attract \ninternational acts such as U.S.-based banjo star Bela Fleck and \nU.K. alt-rockers Maximo Park. \"At the moment it's uncharted territory,\" says Maximo Park \nmanager Colin Schaverien. \"But in five years it will be a \nnatural routing point stop-off on the way to, or back from, \nJapan.\" The current crop of home-grown Beijing talent includes \nModern Sky's goth-influenced \"post-rock\" act the Retros, who \nwill appear at the South by Southwest confab in Austin, while \nambient/electronic rock duo FM3 -- which has been picked up \ninternationally after it was championed by Brian Eno -- has \nscheduled 30 European dates for 2007.\n BERLIN Population: 3.5 million Main Language: German Berlin's central role in the international dance music \nscene has been well-known since the Berlin Wall came down in \n1989. But now the relocated likes of electro artist Peaches; \nher fellow Canadian, techno pioneer Richie Hawtin (a.k.a. \nPlastikman); and U.S. DJ/producers Jay Haze and Stewart Walker \nare rubbing up against a burgeoning rock and pop scene as well. Metal act Rammstein blazed the trail, selling 10 million \nalbums worldwide. Now, with support from a network of 16 local \nradio stations, a new generation of local acts is following in \nRammstein's footsteps. Berlin boy band Tokio Hotel is the \nlatest Pan-European pop sensation, with global sales of more \nthan 2.4 million albums. Alt-rock act Virginia Jetzt has sold 20,000 copies of its \ndebut album, while rock bands El*ke and Superleutnaant and pop \noutfit Naomi are all hot 2007 tips. \"If you live in Berlin,\" Universal Music Germany CEO Frank \nBriegmann says, \"you are at the very heart of modern music.\"\n BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND Population: 1 million Main Language: English In a U.K. music scene perennially dominated by London and \nManchester, England's \"second city\" has struggled, musically, \nin recent years. Yet Birmingham and the surrounding West Midlands region has \nproduced acts ranging from rock monsters Led Zeppelin and Black \nSabbath to Duran Duran. Now, the city -- long derided as an \nindustrial wasteland -- has undergone hefty redevelopment and \nits music scene seems similarly re-energized. Locals say the \nsuccess of the Birmingham-based Editors, whose 2005 debut album \n\"The Back Room\" is BPI-certified platinum (300,000 units), \nhelped shift labels' talent-scouting focus to the city's \nindependent/alt-rock sector. Birmingham alt-rock act the Twang just signed a label deal \nwith B-Unique, the Polydor imprint that's home to the Kaiser \nChiefs. Unsigned acts that could be next in line include the \nWeezer-influenced Murdoch and punky trio the Untitled Musical \nProject, plus the Enemy (from nearby Coventry) and Ripchord \n(from Wolverhampton).\n BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA Population: 2 million Main Language: English The eastern city of Brisbane has launched successful bands \nbefore -- from the Bee Gees in the '60s to Savage Garden in the \n'90s -- but now it has hit such a rich vein of talent that it's \nthreatening Melbourne's traditional role as Australia's main \nmusic city. The city has spawned both of Australia's current biggest \nhome-grown rock and pop groups: Powderfinger (1 million career \nsales) and the Veronicas (350,000 units), as well as solo \nsensation Pete Murray (600,000). Major label execs are now \nregulars in town, looking to do battle with local imprints. \"Brisbane's always a city I keep my eye on,\" says Michael \nParisi, Melbourne-based president of A&R (artists and \nrepertoire) at Warner Music, who helped put the city on the map \nwhen he signed art rock act Regurgitator in the mid-'90s. Parisi's new hip-hop signing Butterfingers heads the pack \nof new, young Brisbane bands looking to break out in 2007; it \nis followed by heavy-rock band the Butterfly Effect and \nsinger/songwriters Andrew Morris, Katie Miller-Heidke and Kate \nBradley. The live scene, based around the city's famous Fortitude \nValley nightclub district, is also booming.\n MARSEILLE, FRANCE Population: 1.2 million Main Language: French This bustling Mediterranean port is France's second city in \nterms of population, behind Paris -- and it's growing, at more \nthan 100,000 people per year. A large population of North African origin, along with the \nnative French and a substantial community from sub-Saharan \nAfrica, make this soccer-mad city an ethno-musical melting pot, \nwhere cheerleaders at Stade Velodrome -- home to leading team \nOlympique Marseille -- use decks and soundsystems. More and more, French promoters describe Marseille's \n10,000-capacity main venue Le Dome as \"a must\" for visiting \nurban talent -- Snoop Dogg and the Roots played there recently, \nwith Beyonce booked for 2007. Following established local rap and reggae acts like IAM \nand Massilia Sound System, politicized female rapper Keny \nArkana has sold 50,000 copies of her debut album \"Entre Ciment \net Belles Etoiles\" despite a refusal to do mainstream \npromotion. Other names to watch include quirky rock/hip-hop duo Oai \nStar, eclectic reggae/Cajun trio Moussu Te Lei Jovents and \nAliman Staff.

{"date": "19:00 01 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " NEW YORK (Billboard) - On Grammy night, U.K. newcomer \nCorinne Bailey Rae hopes to waltz through the door her soulful \npop colleague Norah Jones kicked open in 2003, when she won \nfive awards including best new artist and album of the year. Rae, whose self-titled debut was released internationally \nin February and in June Stateside, will compete on February 11 \nfor best new artist, as well as for record and song of the year \nfor the irresistible \"Put Your Records On.\" Although the track \nstalled at No. 64 on Billboard's flagship Hot 100 singles \nchart, it was a hit at various radio formats. The laid-back craftsmanship of Jones is a definite \ntouchstone of Rae's sound, but the artist also dabbles in \nneo-soul and jazzy arrangements on her debut, which has sold a \nhefty 599,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen \nSoundScan. Sales have increased during six of the past seven \nweeks. And like Jones, Rae has appealed to a wide range of \nconsumers right out of the gate, a fact she attributes to a \nshift in listening tastes. \"I think music is going in two directions,\" she says. \n\"People like a lot of popular music where songs don't mean \nmuch, but it's about hooks, production and little catchy \nthings. Then there are people who also like listening to \nsomeone strumming a guitar and playing a song. I really admire \nboth styles -- the Carole Kings of 'How does a song work?' and \nmore like inventing a new style of production, like on (Snoop \nDogg's) 'Drop It Like It's Hot.' \"I really tried to stay away from what's happening in \ncontemporary music and just listened a lot to the music I love, \nlike Marvin Gaye, Al Green and Stevie Wonder, and thought of \nthat as a benchmark,\" she explains. Rae has built her audience with extensive North American \ntouring and numerous TV appearances, beginning with \"The \nTonight Show With Jay Leno\" and \"Good Morning America\" in June \nand continuing through with mid-December performances on TNT's \n\"Christmas in Washington\" and CBS' \"The Early Show.\" And, in a \nbooking that proves Rae's own idols are embracing her music, \nshe was chosen to perform alongside Wonder at his December 16 \nHouse Full of Toys benefit in Los Angeles. Rae also recently \ntaped an episode of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" with Mary J. Blige \nthat will air January 16. \"I haven't had a chance to really think about (how) anyone \ncould get to hear\" the album, she says. \"Once you've made it \nand it's out there, it works for you, but it has its own life \nand legs and you never know who's going to get to hear it. \nThat's been the amazing thing.\" Rae will return to the road in North America in late winter \nor early spring, according to her U.S. label Capitol, which is \nstill weighing options for the next single from her album.

Elsewhere, Bob Dylan's chart-topping \"Modern Times\" was one \nof the few classic rock albums to go gold last year, and should \nhave been a lock for the album of the year Grammy. And it wasn't even nominated. So that makes it unanimous: Anybody doing great business \nlive is officially banished from the mainstream music business \nforever. One thing's for sure, though. The classic rock generation \ncan be proud of the fact that Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Neil \nYoung, Ray Davies and Pete Townshend continue to be \nartistically adventurous, in spite of a mainstream radio world \nthat obviously isn't interested, and all produced \nuncompromisingly brilliant work in 2006.

{"date": "01:19 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " TORONTO (Hollywood Reporter) - \"Little Mosque on the \nPrairie,\" a Canadian sitcom that debuts Tuesday, depicts \nimmigrant Muslims bumping up against white locals in rural \nSaskatchewan. Zarqa Nawaz, creator and writer of the groundbreaking, \ninsists she's an equal-opportunity satirist taking dead-aim at \nboth Muslim and Canadian stereotypes in a post-September 11 \nworld. \"I expect both groups will be wondering if the other finds \nthe show funny,\" says Nawaz. There are predictable jokes about Muslim beliefs clashing \nwith Canadian traditions. In one scene, a father wearing a \nkufi, or a knitted cap worn by devout Muslims, protests that \nhis Canadian-born daughter wearing a revealing tank top looks \n\"like a Protestant.\" \"Don't you mean prostitute?\" the daughter asks. \"No, I meant a Protestant,\" the father replies. In another scene, a young man of Middle Eastern origins \nwith a Canadian accent is heard in an airport check-in line \ntelling his mother via cell phone that his father shouldn't \nthink his choosing to stop being a Toronto lawyer to become an \nImam in Saskatchewan amounts to career \"suicide.\" \"This is Allah's plan for me,\" the young man says in \npassing, before an arresting cop appears suddenly and tells the \nsurprised lawyer that he won't be making that appointment in \nParadise. Nawaz, a British-born Muslim and mother of four who settled \non the Prairies with her family a decade ago, downplays the \nidea that the homegrown comedy may spark widespread \ncontroversy. She insists her comedy springs from a relatively uneventful \nlife in multicultural North America, unlike Europe, for \nexample, where relations between Muslims and the wider \nChristian community are often a powder keg. \"North America should be the first place where a comedy \nlike this would come about, where Muslims can be comfortable in \ntheir own skin and questions of Canadian identity can produce a \nsitcom,\" she says. To ensure it doesn't cause unforeseen offense with \"Little \nMosque on the Prairie,\" the government-owned Canadian \nBroadcasting Corp. (CBC) has hired an independent \nMuslim-Canadian consultant to comb through the sitcom's \ncreative elements and suggest possible alterations. Kirstine Layfield, CBC executive director of network \nprogramming, says recent preview screenings with select Muslim \naudiences elicited encouraging results -- laughter. \"Just doing the series is a risk in itself, but one the \npublic broadcaster should take on if we're to help communicate \nauthenticity of living in Canada,\" Layfield adds. Mary Darling, one of three executive producers shopping the \nCanadian comedy stateside, says a U.S. airing may help break \ndown barriers between faith communities. \"It won't do any harm, and maybe it can do some good,\" she \nsays.

Ford has been years in the making, a result \nof the wishes of Ford and his family and, in the coverage, \nyears of work by TV networks. Ford's six days of memorials began Friday, when his casket \nwas brought to a Palm Springs church, and continued during the \nweekend in Washington, where his body lay at state in the \nCapitol Rotunda. After Tuesday's funeral, it will be brought to \nGrand Rapids, Mich., where another service will be held and \nthen interment at the president's library and museum. Even though they didn't know when it would occur, network \nTV's preparations for Ford's services were in the planning \nstages since before President Ronald Reagan's passing in 2004. \nFord at 93 was the longest-living former president and had been \nin ill health for a while. \"We've been having pool conversations about this story for \na while now,\" said Phil Alongi, executive producer of NBC News \nspecial coverage. \"This has been in the planning stages for \nyears.\" Like such other big national events as inaugurations and \nState of the Union Addresses, a presidential funeral is covered \nby the so-called network pool that includes ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox \nNews Channel, CNN and MSNBC. Each network takes responsibility \nfor a portion of the event, which will take place in three \nregions of the country and in four states and the District of \nColumbia. \"These logistically are very, very big projects,\" Alongi \nsaid. \"This is one time when all the networks pull together.\" CBS is the pool network for the motorcade and Andrews Air \nForce Base, where the casket was flown to Saturday and due to \nbe flown out of Tuesday. NBC is the pool for the Capitol, ABC \nfor the Washington National Cathedral and Fox News Channel \nhandles the pool for the initial viewing in California and the \nburial in Grand Rapids. CNN is the overall pool producer. \"The assignments are done and the right people have been to \nGrand Rapids a couple of times, they've known where the cameras \nare going to be,\" CNN Washington bureau chief David Bohrman \nsaid. Planning began in earnest after Reagan's funeral in June \n2004, when executives from the networks discussed how the \ncoverage went and what could be improved. Network personnel \nhave gone to the Ford museum and library, where the former \npresident will be buried, several times over the years to plan \nthe coverage. The networks have met several times since 2004 \nabout the coverage of the state funeral; those calls became \ndaily and more frequently after Ford died. While the networks waited until well after the family \nannounced the plans Wednesday, executives said it generally was \nunderstood what each of the former presidents wish when their \ntime comes. \"We know as much as the (National) Military District and \neach presidents' library has decided to share with us,\" Bohrman \nsaid. \"It's usually a lot. The planning is complex and it's in \neverybody's best interest.\" There haven't been many state funerals in recent years, \nwith the first in 30 years for President Reagan. The last one \nwas in 1973 for President Lyndon Baines Johnson. Richard M. \nNixon declined to have a state funeral when he died in 1994.

Eight of the TSX index's 10 main groups retreated but the\nhefty energy and materials groups, which include resources and\ngold-mining shares, were the biggest losers, down 3.9 percent\nand 4 percent respectively. The steep dive in energy issues was pegged to the slide in\noil, which dropped more than 4 percent to settle below $59 a\nbarrel, as unusually warm weather in the U.S. Northeast cut\nheating-oil demand in the world's biggest energy market. Copper prices tumbled to their lowest levels since early\nApril, which weighed on other base metals. \"The overriding reason is potential for slower growth this\nyear weighing on commodity markets,\" said Fergal Smith,\nmanaging market strategist at Action Economics. \"Then, of course, the energy sector has had to contend with\nwarmer weather forecasts,\" he added. \"These are quite big moves\nin percentage terms.\" Despite this, Smith said he does not expect a sustained\npullback.

{"date": "18:07 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "GAZA Clashes erupted between forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and the Hamas government in Gaza on Wednesday, killing five people in the worst fighting since the rivals agreed a fragile truce two weeks ago.At least nine people were wounded in separate incidents across the Gaza Strip, hospital officials said.Abbas's Fatah faction and Hamas declared the ceasefire in the wake of violence that escalated after Abbas called for early elections to break a political deadlock with the Islamists.Hamas condemned Abbas's move as a coup to oust it less than a year after it surprised Fatah to win a parliamentary ballot.The fresh violence is likely to revive fears among Palestinians that Gaza could slip into civil war.Neither has the occupied West Bank, where Palestinians also seek statehood, been spared. Unidentified gunmen abducted a Hamas government aide in Ramallah, security sources said. In Jenin, gunmen fired at the home of Palestinian minister for prisoner affairs, Wasfi Kabha, the sources said. He was unhurt.Among the Gaza dead were three security officials loyal to Abbas who were killed in the southern town of Khan Younis, hospital officials said.Abbas's Preventive Security force said the three died when a Hamas police unit ambushed two of its vehicles. Hamas said the security force fired first.WOMAN KILLEDIn the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza, one woman was killed after getting caught in the crossfire of a fierce clash between rival forces. Nine others were wounded, mostly combatants, hospital officials said.That clash came after unknown gunmen killed a Fatah member who was on a rooftop in the town of Beit Lahiya and a car carrying Hamas security officers was ambushed. Two policemen were wounded in the ambush, the Hamas police force said.Gunmen also abducted four Fatah members from the streets, witnesses said. Fatah blamed Hamas, which declined to comment.While Abbas has called for fresh parliamentary and presidential elections, he has left the door open to talks with Hamas on forging a unity government that Palestinians hope will lead to the lifting of Western sanctions imposed on the Hamas administration.On top of the internal chaos, general law and order has deteriorated in Gaza in recent months.Palestinian colleagues of a Peruvian photographer abducted by gunmen this week demanded his release on Wednesday, saying the 50-year-old's life was in danger because he needed medicine for heart disease.Sakher Abu El-Awn, Gaza office manager of the French news agency Agence France-Presse, said Jaime Razuri, who was seized outside the AFP Gaza City office on Monday, was taking several types of medication, including some for the heart problems.\"We believe his life is at serious risk and we urge his captors to release him immediately,\" Abu El-Awn told Reuters.Razuri's kidnapping is the latest in a spate of abductions of foreign journalists and aid workers in Gaza in the past year. All have been freed unharmed.No one has claimed responsibility for Razuri's abduction.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-palestinians-idUSL0955322120070103", "sectors": [["World"]], "title": "five killed in gaza infighting"},
{"date": "18:10 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "NEW YORK Jan 3 A criminal case against KPMG\nLLP relating to alleged tax fraud has been dropped because the\naccounting firm complied with terms of an agreement with the\ngovernment, federal prosecutors said on Wednesday. KPMG had agreed in August 2005 to pay $456 million, accept\nan outside monitor and admit to wrongdoing in resolving a\nfederal investigation into questionable tax shelters. The deferred prosecution agreement expired on Dec. 31. U.S.\nDistrict Judge Loretta Preska issued an order, made public on\nWednesday, agreeing with a request by the U.S. Attorney for the\nSouthern District of New York to drop a criminal conspiracy\ncharge against KPMG. But 16 former KPMG [KPMG.UL] partners and two others still\nface criminal charges accusing them of helping cheat the\ngovernment out of $2.5 billion by creating bogus tax shelters\nfor wealthy clients. A trial is scheduled to begin Sept. 17. \"Today's dismissal of the charge reflects our commitment to\nfull and continuing compliance with the agreement we made with\nthe government,\" KPMG Chief Executive Timothy Flynn said in a\nstatement. \"We regret the past activities that led to these\ncharges.\" By avoiding an indictment, KPMG may have avoided the fate\nof another accountant, Arthur Andersen, which dissolved after\nbeing indicted over its role in Enron Corp.'s 2001 collapse.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in 2005 overturned Andersen's subsequent\nconviction. Prosecutors have been dealt several blows in the KPMG case.\nIn July, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled that the\ngovernment unconstitutionally pressured KPMG to withhold\npayment of legal fees on behalf of the 16 former partners. The U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments in\nNovember on whether Kaplan or an outside arbitrator -- as\nrequested by KPMG -- should decide who should pay the fees. After the case began, the U.S. Justice Department decided\nto revise its policies for investigating business wrongdoing,\nsaying prosecutors will not be able to consider payment of\nemployees' legal bills -- except under rare circumstances --\nwhen deciding whether to charge a company with a crime. At a hearing last month, Kaplan said he was likely to\nreject prosecutors' request to split the defendants into two\ngroups for separate trials.\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/crime-kpmg-idUSN0343425820070103", "sectors": [["Regulatory News"]], "title": "prosecutors drop criminal case against kpmg"},
{"date": "18:11 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " (Recasts, updates comment, prices) By Ellen FreilichNEW YORK Jan 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended little\nchanged in their 2007 debut session  on Wednesday, as minutes\nfrom the Federal Reserve's latest meeting renewed concerns\nabout the strength of the economy and corporate profits and\nhalted an early rally, while oil prices plunged 4 percent. Energy stocks suffered their biggest one-day fall in over a\nyear on the lower oil prices, with Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and\nChevron (CVX.N) both down, but positive analyst comments\nprompted a gain in the shares of Web search leader Google Inc.\n(GOOG.O), which helped support the Nasdaq. U.S. government bond prices rose on Wednesday on weak\nprivate-sector jobs data and as the minutes from the Fed's Dec.\n12 policy meeting showed a central bank wary of slowing\neconomic growth. Gains were tempered, however, by a December\nindex of U.S. factory activity that came in stronger than\nexpected. The Fed's concern over potentially slower growth marginally\nboosted investor expectations that the central bank could\nconsider an official interest rate cut later this year. \"Stocks went from the plus column into the red after the\nFed minutes cited downside economic risks, and this helped\nsupport bond prices as well,\" said Chris Rupkey, senior\nfinancial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York. DECEMBER U.S. FACTORY INDEX STRONGER THAN EXPECTED At mid-morning, news that the Institute for Supply\nManagement's manufacturing index climbed to 51.4, above the 50\nthreshold that separates expansion in the sector from\ncontraction, hurt Treasuries and helped stocks. But the impact of that report wore off as the day\nprogressed. The Dow and the Nasdaq ended the first 2007 trading session\nonly slightly higher, while the S&P 500 dipped as a sharp\nsell-off in energy shares and worries about economic growth\neclipsed Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s (WMT.N) upbeat sales forecast\nand a jump in Home Depot Inc. (HD.N) after its chief executive\nofficer quit. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 11.37 points,\nor 0.09 percent, to finish at 12,474.52. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC gained 7.87 points, or\n0.33 percent, to end at 2,423.16. But the Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX slipped 1.67\npoints, or 0.12 percent, to close at 1,416.63. BONDS RISE AFTER JOBS REPORT Treasuries had also rallied early in the day after a\nsurprise contraction in a private jobs report which hinted the\nnonfarm payrolls report on Friday could prove soft. After the\ndata, economists at some Wall Street banks cut their forecasts\nfor the government's nonfarm payrolls report. Data showed that U.S. private sector employment likely\ndeclined by 40,000 in December, the first contraction since\nApril 2003, according to the ADP National Employment Report. The falling oil prices also contributed to the rally in\nbonds. \"Falling commodity prices, especially oil, are exactly what\nyou see in a slowing economy, so this trend accentuated buying\nof bonds,\" Rupkey said. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR rose 5/32 in price for\na yield of 4.66 percent from 4.68 percent late on Tuesday. DOLLAR RISES ON FACTORY DATA The U.S. dollar advanced broadly on Wednesday, hitting\ntwo-month highs against the yen, after the Institute for Supply\nManagement a survey showed the U.S. factory sector expanded in\nDecember, defying forecasts of another modest contraction. \"The fact that ISM came back above 50 put the whole\nsoft-landing, dollar-positive scenario back in play,\" said\nBoris Schlossberg, senior currency strategist at Forex Capital\nMarkets in New York. Led by strong gains against European currencies including\nsterling, the euro and the Swiss franc, the dollar had its\nbiggest rise in around six months against a basket of six major\ncurrencies .DXY. The euro EUR= was trading down 0.9 percent on the day at\n$1.3159, its biggest one-day decline since mid-July of last\nyear. Meanwhile, sterling tumbled 1.2 percent to $1.9495\nGBP=, its biggest one-day decline since July 2005. The dollar was up 0.5 percent at 119.35 yen JPY= after\nreaching as high as 119.68 on electronic trading platform EBS. The dollar rose around 1.1 percent against the Swiss\ncurrency, to 1.2264 francs CHF=. Oil prices plunged 4 percent to below $59 on Wednesday --\nthe biggest one-day percentage drop in front month crude since\na 4.78 percent drop on April 27, 2005 -- as mild weather in the\nU.S. Northeast cut fuel demand in the world's biggest heating\noil market and signs emerged that investor interest in\ncommodities was flagging. U.S. crude CLc1 settled down $2.73 to $58.32 a barrel,\nthe lowest settlement since Nov. 17, before trading down to\n$57.72 in after hours electronic trade. London Brent LCOc1\nplunged $2.48 to $57.96 a barrel.\n ( ((Additional reporting by Emily Chasan, Chris Reese and Nick\nOlivari))\n\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/markets-global-idUSN0362045720070103", "sectors": [["Bonds"]], "title": "global markets - stocks little changed on renewed economy worries"},
{"date": "18:20 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "WASHINGTON Foreign countries, especially nations in the Asia-Pacific region, have intensified their efforts to steal sensitive U.S. defense technology, according to a Pentagon report circulated on Wednesday.The Defense Security Service Counterintelligence Office recorded an annual jump of nearly 43 percent in the number of suspicious foreign contacts reported to U.S. authorities by defense contractors and other defense-related sources.The agency, which helps protect the U.S. defense industry from foreign espionage, said in an unclassified report that spies used phony business offers and computer hackers to target advanced U.S. technology including lasers, sensors, missiles and other systems. The report covered the fiscal year ending September 2005 and is the most recent for which complete statistics are available.In one case, a female spy seduced an American translator to learn his computer password. His unclassified network was later found to be infected by viruses planted by a foreign intelligence service.The total number of suspicious foreign contacts climbed to 971 during fiscal year 2005, the report said. The number of countries trying to obtain U.S. technology also rose, to 106 from 90 a year earlier.\"The majority of reported targeting originated from East Asia and the Pacific, which accounted for 31 percent of all reporting,\" the Pentagon agency said in the report.The Near East made up 23.1 percent of the targeting, followed by Eurasia at 19.3 percent and South Asia at 13.2 percent. Africa and the Western Hemisphere, not including the United States, accounted for 11.5 percent.The report, entitled \"Technology Collection Trends in the U.S. Defense Industry,\" did not accuse specific countries of espionage. But U.S. officials have long identified China, Russia and Iran as the leading counterintelligence threats to the United States.The Defense Security Service posted its 29-page report on a password-protected government Web site.The Washington Times newspaper first reported on the report's existence on Wednesday. The Federation of American Scientists, a nonprofit group that advocates for government openness, later posted the document on its own Web site.The Defense Security Service did not return phone calls seeking comment.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-security-usa-technology-idUSN0342916920070103", "sectors": [["Tech"]], "title": "foreign spying on u . s . defense technology seen rising"},

{"date": "18:32 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "SAN FRANCISCO The San Francisco Giants presented Barry Zito, the most expensive pitcher in baseball history, as a new team leader on Wednesday, but stayed silent on controversial slugger Barry Bonds.The Giants signed Zito, the 2002 American League Cy Young winner, last week to a seven-year, $126 million contract. Local media reported he would be earning nearly $5,000 a pitch as someone who plays only every four or five games.Zito talked about his leadership qualities for a National League team long divided by Bonds, whose reputation has been clouded by the BALCO steroid scandal.\"Half of my role here is to pitch on the field. The other half is to help everyone else be the best they can,\" the left-handed thrower, who was 16-10 with a 3.83 ERA in the 2006 season with the American League A's across San Francisco Bay in Oakland, told a news conference.Other team mates have privately grumbled about the team's longtime dominant pitcher Bonds, who is within striking distance of becoming the all-time Major League Baseball home-run king next season. Recent books have chronicled sometimes abrasive behavior by Bonds toward team mates.The Giants reportedly agreed last month to pay the record seven-times MVP $16 million to carry on for another season, but declined on Wednesday to discuss the player that has brought them so much joy as well as headaches.\"I'm not gong to say anything about the other Barry,\" team president Peter Magowan said when asked if the contract had been finalized.A spokesman later said the deal has not been completed. Bonds also faces legal uncertainty, as federal prosecutors are believed to be investigating whether he lied to a grand jury when he testified that he had never knowingly used steroids.UPBEAT OUTLOOKZito contrasted the other Barry with a sunny disposition, speaking at one point about \"a lot of good vibes flowing around here.\"Magowan highlighted Zito's attributes that do not appear in the statistics on a baseball card.\"What I think sets Barry above so many other very skilled players are the other things he brings to the table,\" Magowan said.\"He is a combination of charisma and dedication and desire that makes him a truly special player and that's the kind of things this organization wants to be associated with on a long-term basis,\" he said.Magowan acknowledged that a record long-term contract posed risks, but cited Zito's work ethic, track record of not missing a start throughout his career and relatively young age of 28.\"Those are three factors that don't eliminate the risk but reduce it,\" he said.Asked about the risk of such a lucrative deal, Zito said: \"I think my work ethic has led to the durability....My work ethic and determination are only going to increase.\"", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-baseball-zito-idUSN0343289420070103", "sectors": [["Sports"]], "title": "san francisco hails zito ' s arrival , silent on bonds"},

For the year, sales at GM dropped 7.7 percent to 421,299 in\nwhat the company termed a \"transition year\" as it tried to\nreduce its reliance on sales incentives to attract customers. Canada's other major automakers managed to notch gains for\n2006, helped by resurgent end-of year sales.

{"date": "18:39 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "BOSTON Two Parkinson's disease drugs cause the same kind of heart damage that led to the withdrawal of the diet drug combination \"fen-phen,\" according to two studies published on Wednesday.Patients taking the drugs pergolide, developed by Eli Lilly & Co. and sold under the brand name Permax, and cabergoline, developed by Pfizer Inc. and sold under the brand Dostinex, had a sharply higher risk of heart valve damage than those taking other therapies, the studies said.The studies, one of which analyzed the records of 11,417 patients in Britain and one of which tested 245 patients in Italy, reinforce the results of earlier, smaller studies showing drugs that activate a cellular receptor known as 5-HT2b can cause damage to the heart valve, a serious condition that can lead to heart failure and sudden death.\"We recommend that physicians not prescribe drugs that have this biochemical property,\" said Bryan Roth, a researcher at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who was not involved in the trials, but viewed the data and commented on it in The New England Journal of Medicine, where both studies appeared.Michael Berelowitz, a Pfizer senior vice president, said cabergoline has very modest sales and is only approved in the United States for hyperprolactinemia -- a condition in which excessive amounts of the hormone prolactin enter the bloodstream due to benign tumors of the pituitary gland.He said benefits of the Pfizer drug, which is sold in Europe for Parkinson's disease, as well as hyperprolactinemia, outweigh the increased risk of heart valve damage, which is noted in the drug's package insert label.Lilly officials could not immediately be reached for comment.Such drugs also include the migraine headache drug ergotamine and the amphetamine derivative known as \"ecstasy.\"Roth said his team, in a separate piece of research that has yet to be published or reviewed by the scientific community, has identified several other big-selling drugs that have until now not been known to activate the 5-HT2b receptor.He declined to reveal the names of the drugs until the research has been published.\"We recommend that every drug be screened at this receptor before it goes into humans,\" Roth told Reuters in an interview. \"It costs just pennies per drug for such a screen.\"The British study showed patients taking pergolide were 7.1 times more likely to develop heart valve damage than those who took other treatments. Patients taking the highest doses of the drug had a 37 times greater risk.The study showed patients taking cabergoline were 4.9 times more likely to develop heart valve damage. At higher doses patients were 50.3 times more likely to suffer damage.Both drugs are available in generic form.A second study, conducted in Italy, tested 245 people, of whom 155 had Parkinson's disease. Of the diseased population, one group received pergolide, one group received cabergoline and one group received an alternative Parkinson's treatment. The non-diseased control group received nothing.The results showed that 23.4 percent of patients taking pergolide and 28.6 percent of patients taking cabergoline suffered heart damage, compared with just 5.6 percent in the control group.\"These are huge risks,\" said Roth.He added they were similar to the kind of damage seen with fen-phen, whose main ingredients were withdrawn in 1997 and forced the drug-maker Wyeth to take more than $21 billion in charges to cover liabilities.Wyeth's recalled drugs were fenfluramine, or Pondimin, and dexfenfluramine, or Redux. To make fen-phen, one or the other was combined with another drug called phentermine that is still sold by other companies.Wyeth, then called American Home Products, recalled Pondimin and Redux after some of the 6 million Americans who had taken fen-phen developed heart-valve problems.Roth said pergolide is also used to treat restless leg syndrome, a condition in which patients feel a crawling sensation in their legs combined with a need to move them.(Additional reporting by Ransdell Pierson in New York)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-parkinsons-drug-idUSN0344216720070103", "sectors": [["Health"]], "title": "parkinson ' s drugs can cause heart damage -- studies"},

{"date": "18:41 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "WASHINGTON U.S. military planners ordered to draft options for a quick boost to troop levels in Iraq are weighing moves to send another Army brigade or delay the departure of Marines already in the war zone, defense officials said this week.The ongoing review, which has yielded a variety of distinct scenarios, is aimed at giving President George W. Bush a set of alternatives as he considers a broad new policy for the deteriorating situation in Iraq.A quick, short-term troop increase, or \"surge,\" is just one of many policy changes under consideration. But it is the one that has garnered the most attention in Washington, as American military casualties in Iraq have climbed above 3,000 and analysts question whether a troop increase can stem violence.Surge options developed by military planners have ranged widely and could include as many as 10,000 to 30,000 additional troops, according to defense officials speaking on condition of anonymity. The United States now has 132,000 troops in Iraq.The plans also differ in how quickly more troops could be deployed, officials said.Under one plan, the Pentagon could most quickly increase troop levels by 7,000 to 8,000 by moving in two Army brigades -- one now headed to Kuwait to serve as a standby force and another that has not been announced.The Pentagon also could boost troop levels quickly in Baghdad by delaying the anticipated departure of two Marine Corps units now in violent Anbar province, defense officials have said. That option could provide an additional 13,000 to 15,000 troops to Iraq's capital.Other plans, including those aimed at providing 20,000 or more troops, could take longer to implement, until as late as April, some officials said.MILITARY CONCERNSome generals, including Gen. John Abizaid, the U.S. Middle East commander due to retire early this year, have raised concerns about the concept of a surge, saying it would heighten opposition to the American presence.Some critics have said the plan helps Bush satisfy political interests rather than military goals.That is because the mission, defense officials say, is to train Iraqi forces to help them take responsibility for security. Repeatedly, commanders on the ground have said they do not need more troops to accomplish that mission.Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who has not disclosed what options he prefers, also said commanders were worried that additional forces would allow Iraqis to ease away from taking security responsibility.White House spokesman Tony Snow said Bush is \"fairly far along\" in deciding how to proceed on Iraq but has not completed his new plan.Bush is expected to unveil a new Iraq policy as early as next week.\"If he goes forward with the idea presumably it means he thinks it will have a positive effect,\" said incoming House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat.\"But of course the president has been almost uniformly wrong on what his premise is, of what his actions in Iraq were going to result in, whether it is cost or success, stabilization, support, sectarian violence,\" Hoyer said. \"You name it, their observations have been wrong.\"(Additional reporting by Steve Holland and Susan Cornwell)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-iraq-usa-troops-idUSN0329266320070103", "sectors": [], "title": "military planners assess options for iraq"},

{"date": "02:30 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " LOS ANGELES (Billboard) - If 2006 was the year of \nuser-generated content, 2007 will be the year the music \nindustry learns to generate new revenue from the hugely popular \ntrend. Labels are striking licensing deals with sites like YouTube \nso that fans can post copyrighted content or include it in \nvideos they make themselves. Additionally, labels are expected \nto start releasing new types of content -- such as unused clips \nor video montages -- specifically created for fans to \nmanipulate in new ways. By doing so, record labels can then share in the \nadvertising revenue these sites collect. Rather than just suing \nYouTube and its ilk for how their sites are used, the music \nindustry can now profit from them, not to mention reap the \npromotional benefits. \"They're doing it anyway,\" says Ted Cohen, former EMI Music \nGroup digital executive and now founding partner of consulting \nfirm TAG Strategic. \"There's a chance to monetize this \nbehavior.\" Additionally, music companies have the chance to let their \nfans actually sell music to one another via playlist-sharing \nservices and peer-recommendation sites. Word-of-mouth marketing \nis exploding online through user-generated activity, creating a \nnew generation of tastemakers. How well labels tap this \neffective source of music discovery will be a barometer of \ntheir overall digital strategies. Here are five technologies shaping this space:\n SNOCAP Launched with much fanfare in 2005, SnoCap has generated \nlittle momentum to date. But after scoring a big win with \nMySpace, which selected it to power its digital music service, \n2007 could be SnoCap's year. The company's audio fingerprinting \ntechnologies -- as well as those from Audible Magic and \nGracenote -- will play a key role in monetizing user-generated \ncontent by shifting the burden of acquiring licenses for \ncopyrighted works from the end user to the service provider. \nEach time a fan uploads a copyrighted track, for whatever \npurpose, the technology notes who owns the rights, which ad is \non the page hosting the content and how much the service \nprovider is then owed.\n BRIGHTCOVE Another method of monetizing existing behavior, Brightcove \nworks with content owners like Warner Music Group to make \nvideoclips available to fans wishing to post content on their \nblog or Web site. Its embedded video technology then tracks how \nmany times a given clip is viewed and compensates rights \nholders via its advertising platform. With broadband now in 80% \nof U.S. Internet households, analysts expect video to be the \nmost important form of online media next year.\n VENICE PROJECT Analyst group In-Stat predicts that the Venice Project's \npeer-to-peer video project will be \"the big viral media \nsensation of 2007.\" Founded by the brains behind Kazaa and \nSkype -- Janus Friis and Niklas Zennstrom -- the service uses \nP2P technology to distribute video a la BitTorrent, but also \nlets users modify the content within the rules that copyright \nholders set in advance. Unlike Kazaa, the Venice Project is \nbuilt from the get-go with a business model and respect for \ncopyrights, and already has attracted Paramount Pictures, MTV \nNetworks, Twentieth Century Fox Film and Warner Bros. Home \nEntertainment to the fold.\n ILIKE iLike is one of several taste-matching sites designed to \noffer music recommendations by comparing the musical \npreferences of members and matching those with similar \ninterests. The sites' social-networking aspect provides a human \nelement to counter competitors that rely too heavily on \nalgorithms, and iLike's integration of Apple's iTunes music \nservice sets it apart from the pack. None of these \nmusic-discovery services -- others include Last.fm, MOG and \nMercora -- actually sell music themselves, instead linking to \nother services and often not taking a cut. But Ticketmaster's \nmid-December 25% investment in iLike illustrates how digital \nretailers and other music interests will seek to either partner \nor acquire such sites to better-link the discovery process with \na sale.\n PASSALONG Peer-retailing services like PassAlong reward users for the \nsale of each digital track they recommend to friends. So far \nsuch services haven't been a big hit. But PassAlong's answer \nhas been to branch out with applications like OnTour, which \nnotify users when any artist in their digital music library is \nscheduled to appear in their town. As more social networks \nfollow MySpace's lead and enter the digital music retail game, \npeer retailers like PassAlong, Weedshare and Peer Impact will \nbecome ripe for acquisition.

{"date": "05:30 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Call it the year of \nsmoke and mirrors. When 2006 began, fearful studio executives \nwere still reeling with the first down year in DVD history. \nThey were anxiously looking for salvation, and hoping to find \nit in high-definition discs, digital downloads or perhaps a \ncombination of the two. The next generation of software did launch in 2006, \nregrettably with two incompatible formats, first HD-DVD in \nApril and then Blu-ray Disc in June. Digital downloading began \nas well, with all the big Hollywood studios aggressively \nselling their hot new movies on Movielink, CinemaNow, Apple's \niTunes and other download services. Studio executives even \ncoined a new term, \"electronic sell-through,\" or EST, for the \nlucrative business model. But in the end, none of these technological marvels really \nmattered. High-def discs still are a blip on the sales radar, \nand digital downloading are even less of a blip. And lo and \nbehold, what saved the day for home entertainment was an \nunexpected resurgence in the DVD market, fueled by a powerful \nslate of summer theatricals. \"What we're looking at is a market that is up slightly from \nlast year, overall,\" said David Bishop, president of Sony \nPictures Home Entertainment. \"But if you break down the \ncomponents, we're projecting DVD sales to be up 3 percent, \nyear-over-year, and rental to be up about 12 percent. What \ndrags the industry down to a flat or slightly up basis is that \nVHS sales and rentals are virtually going away.\" \"The industry is up as a whole, despite a decrease in \noverall pricing,\" added Kelley Avery, president of worldwide \nhome entertainment at Paramount Pictures. \"Contrary to popular \nbelief, reports of the decline of DVD have been exaggerated.\" Much of the optimism floating around the studio DVD \ndivisions stems from the exceptionally strong fourth quarter. \nThings got off to a good start when Fox's \"X-Men: The Last \nStand\" and Disney's \"The Little Mermaid Platinum Edition\" \ngenerated $80 million in consumer spending in a single day. \nFurther triumphs came as the quarter progressed, culminating \nthis month when Disney's \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's \nChest\" sold 10.5 million DVDs its first week in stores, putting \nit on track to become the top-selling live-action DVD ever. The fourth-quarter DVD sales rally was probably the biggest \nhome entertainment story of 2006, even though it didn't make \nthe biggest headlines. That honor went to the launch of the two \nhigh-def disc formats and the flurry of major studio deals with \ndigital downloading services. On the packaged-media front, the launch of two rival, \nincompatible formats was, if not a disaster, a major \ndisappointment. But the real culprit, and the reason software \nsales have been anemic (fewer than 10,000 units of even a \nreally big title are typical), wasn't so much a lack of a \nunified standard. It was the fact that consumer electronics \nmanufacturers really dropped the ball, with a series of delays \nthat really pinged adoption rates. The HD-DVD camp never got \nbeyond two Toshiba models, including an entry-level model \nretailing for $499, while only at the very end of the year did \nBlu-ray get additional players to join the $999 Samsung model \nthat arrived in stores in late June. \"Everyone was disappointed in the quantity (of players) \nthat came out of the electronics companies,\" said Warner Home \nVideo president Ron Sanders. \"But what is encouraging is that \nthe attach rate of the software was amazingly high. On average, \nconsumers bought 28 to 30 movies per set-top box, and that's \njust below what it was for DVD in the same time frame.\" Digital downloading, simmering on the back burner for \nseveral years, also had its official coming out in April when \nfive of the six major studios begin selling downloads of their \nmovies over the Internet, through services Movielink and \nCinemaNow. New releases went out day-and-date with the DVDs. \nHoldout Disney soon joined the party, and by year's end, the \ntwo dedicated download services were joined by a wide variety \nof others, including Apple's iTunes, Amazon.com and \nfile-swapping service BitTorrent. The only hitch was that in \nmost cases, downloaded movies could not be burned to standard \nDVDs for easy transport into the living room. In the retail world, the mass merchants continued to \nclobber each other over price and exclusive gifts with purchase \non hot new theatrical DVD releases, while two veteran \naudio-video combo chains, Musicland and Tower Records and \nVideo, bit the dust. The former was acquired by Trans World \nEntertainment after filing for bankruptcy, while Tower was \nliquidated. So what lies ahead for 2007? For starters, studio \npresidents expect big things from high-def discs. The prognosis \nfor 2007 is that one of the two rival formats will fall by the \nwayside, consumer electronics makers will rally and start \ncranking out players, the Chinese will weigh in with cheap \nplayers of their own and by the fourth quarter, high-def discs \nwill be a viable, significant business. \"Consumers are buying more high-definition TVs than ever \nbefore,\" said Craig Kornblau, president of Universal Studios \nHome Entertainment. And once they get hooked on high-definition \nentertainment through digital cable, he said, consumers are \ngoing to want, even expect, high-def content from all their \nmedia, spurring demand for high-def discs. The digital download market, too, is expected to grow \nsignificantly, particularly with the prospect that consumers \nwill be able to burn downloaded movies onto DVDs playable in \ntheir set-top units. CinemaNow introduced the download-to-burn \noption on select catalog titles during the summer, but this \nyear the gates are expected to be thrust wide open. Depending on how well the summer theatrical features fare \nat the box office, studio chiefs say 2007 could be a very good \nyear, overall, for home entertainment.

{"date": "04:53 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " LOS ANGELES (Billboard) - The anti-digital rights \nmanagement (DRM) bandwagon is getting more crowded by the day. \nEven some major-label executives are pushing for the right to \nsell digital downloads as unprotected MP3s. In 2007, the majors will get the message, and the DRM wall \nwill begin to crumble. Why? Because they'll no longer be able \nto point to a growing digital marketplace as justification that \nDRM works. Revenue from digital downloads and mobile content is \nexpected to be flat or, in some cases, decline next year. If \nthe digital market does in fact stall, alternatives to DRM will \nlook much more attractive. Revenue from digital music has yet to offset losses from \nstill-declining CD sales, and digital track sales remain a \ncause for concern. Month-over-month download figures were \nlargely flat through 2006, even in the face of year-over-year \ngains. If the expected post-holiday spike in download numbers \nthat has occurred in the past two years is weak, look for the \nglass on the panic button to break. \"People in the industry will have a very different \nconversation in January when the dust clears and they realize \njust how bad this year really was,\" says Eric Garland, CEO of \npeer-to-peer (P2P) tracking firm BigChampagne. Even more of a concern is mobile. According to Gartner G2 \nanalyst Mike McGuire, the ringtone market -- currently \ncontributing more than half of all digital revenue -- will \nsoften during the next 12-18 months as it matures. Meanwhile, the music industry wants a strong competitor to \nthe monster it created called iTunes. Forcing would-be \ncompetitors to sell music incompatible with the popular iPod is \nnot showing any signs of working. Removing DRM would attract \npowerful new players to the market, and that -- the theory goes \n-- will result in more buyers. \"The majors . . . have got to capitulate, or they will \ncontinue to have a fractured digital media market that will \nslow down and stagnate,\" says Terry McBride, president of \nNettwerk Music Group, management home of such acts as Sarah \nMcLachlan and Avril Lavigne. Here are five places to watch this year's DRM developments:\n AMAZON The online retailer reportedly is itching to get into \ndigital downloads but is holding out for a DRM-free service. It \nsells as many iPods as anybody and is a haven for music that is \ndisappearing from physical retail shelves. \"They already have a \nrelationship with our consumer the way that a lot of others \ndon't,\" Blue Note GM Zach Hochkeppel says. Viewed as the \nbiggest threat to iTunes, Amazon has the power to force a DRM \nstrategy shift.\n LIMEWIRE Still in the process of settling with the music industry, \nthe P2P file-sharing service wants to start charging its 40 \nmillion users $1 per download and share the revenue and \nuser-behavior information with the music industry. But it wants \nto stay DRM-free. The company hired TAG Strategic consultant \nTed Cohen, a former EMI exec, to convince the majors to at \nleast test the idea for six months.\n MYSPACE The most popular Internet destination in the world is \nworking with SnoCap to launch a music download service that \nwould let musicians sell music directly from their profiles and \nthat of their fans. But it will only sell files as MP3s. It is \nmoving ahead by focusing on independent and unsigned artists \nwilling to release unprotected music, and a successful showing \nwould make the majors take notice.\n EMUSIC The indie-only specialist just surpassed 100 million \ndownloads; it's the second-largest digital music retailer after \niTunes, all sans DRM. CEO David Packman says he is not \ninterested in selling major-label fare, but he may have no \nchoice if majors suddenly allow his competitors to sell in MP3 \nas well. But even if the majors did relent to MP3 sales on \neMusic, the company's business model would have to change--no \nlabel will agree to 50 downloads for $15 per month.\n YAHOO MUSIC GM David Goldberg has convinced Sony BMG and EMI Music \nGroup to test the DRM-free waters with limited, promotional \n\"experiments\" involving Jessica Simpson, Jesse McCartney, \nRelient K and Norah Jones. The lessons learned from these tests \nwill either speed or slow their path to eliminating DRM.

Security Council voted on December 23 to ban transfers to Iran of nuclear materials or know-how of possible use in uranium enrichment, fuel-reprocessing or heavy-water reactors. Each process can yield energy for electricity or explosives.The resolution also prohibits IAEA technical aid related to enrichment, fuel-reprocessing or heavy-water activity, while exempting projects that are for \"food, agricultural, medical, safety or other humanitarian purposes\".IAEA diplomats said the agency was not providing technical aid in the banned sectors to Iran or any other member state -- reflecting its covenant to both foster peaceful atomic power and deter diversions to bombmaking through regular inspections.RADIOISOTOPESBut in a December 27 letter to board members, IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei said the Council had \"decided to restrict the scope\" of nuclear technical aid to Iran and the board would need to \"consider the relevant obligations\" for the agency.Pending the IAEA Secretariat's evaluation, ElBaradei said he would ensure that existing technical aid would be \"limited to activities authorized\" by the Security Council.Of the 20-odd items of technical aid Iran has received since 1997, most involve work in radiopharmaceuticals, radioactive waste management, radioisotopes for medical care, nuclear power planning, and nuclear safety regulations.But at least one project dating to 2001, on the \"feasibility of upgrading a research reactor\", could well be killed off by the sanctions resolution, one senior IAEA diplomat said.A European Union diplomat said up to 11 of the projects could be in jeopardy as they could be associated with fuel production targeted by the Security Council, \"but we will see what the agency (secretariat) has to say\".At the last regular board meeting in November, Iran's bid for IAEA safety expertise for a heavy-water reactor was put on indefinite hold after days of haggling between developing and Western states, who originally wanted more projects slashed too.\"The catch now, under sanctions, is how do we interpret the technical aid projects designated as 'humanitarian'? Those who want to put the squeeze on Iran can find ways to do that,\" said an ambassador for a major developing nation on the IAEA board.\"But ElBaradei has things under control. So a special board will only raise temperatures, not cool them down which we need so at the end of the day we get a return to negotiations on a diplomatic solution (on Iran),\" he said.Iran, the world's No. 4 oil exporter, says it wants nuclear fuel only for power plants, not for bombs as the United States and EU allies -- who sponsored sanctions -- suspect.But Iran bred mistrust abroad by hiding atomic research from the IAEA for 18 years, failing to satisfy agency investigators since that its goals are wholly peaceful, and ignoring a Security Council demand in July to halt enrichment work.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-iran-nuclear-iaea-idUSL0314401020070103", "sectors": [], "title": "atom watchdog reviews iran aid amidst sanctions"},
{"date": "18:52 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "WASHINGTON The House of Representatives plans to pass rules this week to reduce U.S. budget deficits, but a senior Democrat on Wednesday said he was open to bending those rules to fix a tax that otherwise will hit growing numbers of middle-income households.Rep. John Spratt of South Carolina, the incoming chairman of the House Budget Committee, said Democrats might decide to waive new budget rules so that Congress can keep upper middle-class taxpayers from getting caught by a tax originally intended for the wealthy.Under the new budget rules called \"paygo,\" spending increases or tax cuts would have to be paid for with savings elsewhere in the budget or tax code. But that could make it harder for Democrats to keep their promise to eliminate deficits in five years while providing tax relief for the middle class.Over the next several years, an estimated 20 million to 30 million middle-class taxpayers whose incomes rise with inflation could be forced to pay the alternative minimum tax, even though it was intended to prevent the very wealthy from using exemptions to avoid paying taxes.Congress has approved a series of temporary fixes for the tax that was first enacted in 1969, but put off any permanent resolution because of its huge impact on the budget. Democrats say a more permanent fix for the AMT would cost the Treasury about $641 billion over 10 years.Spratt said that under rules the new Democratic House majority plans to pass on Friday, there will be no exemptions to paygo. But he added, \"That's not to say that you couldn't come back later in a budget resolution and have some sort of a dispensation from the rule for a certain-sized tax cut.\"Republicans, including President George W. Bush's budget chief, Rob Portman, oppose the paygo rule, saying it will only encourage Congress to pass tax increases to reduce deficits.\"It's a plan to raise taxes, plain and simple,\" said Rep. Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican and senior Budget Committee member.Instead, Republicans say the government collects enough tax revenue and they want deficit cuts to be achieved by paring domestic spending. But over the past several years, while they controlled both houses of Congress, domestic spending rose significantly.For fiscal 2006, which ended on September 30, the budget deficit was $247.7 billion.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-usa-congress-budget-idUSN0343544620070103", "sectors": [["Politics, ", "Bonds"]], "title": "democrats may bend budget rule for tax fix"},

However, the data was eclipsed by minutes from the Federal \nReserve's December 12 policy meeting, which showed some members \nwere becoming a bit anxious about the economy and a separate \nreport saying private-sector employment fell in December -- the \nfirst time in three years. The Fed minutes released on Wednesday said that while \ninflation was the predominant concern, some members felt the \n\"subdued tone\" of economic data meant risks to growth had \nincreased. \"Several members judged that the subdued tone of some \nincoming indicators meant that the downside risks to economic \ngrowth in the near term had increased a little and become a bit \nmore broadly based than previously thought,\" said the minutes. Government bond prices edged higher, while the dollar \ninitially fell on the minutes. Stocks dipped after the minutes \nwere released. But analysts said little weight should be attached to the \nminutes as they had been overtaken by recent data pointing to a \nresilient economy. \"This Fed meeting was held before the spate of reports, \nstarting with retail sales in the middle of December, that \nshowed the economy looking more resilient,\" said Cary Leahey, \nmanaging director at Decision Economics in New York. Earlier, the Institute for Supply Management said its index \nof national factory activity climbed to 51.4 from 49.5 in \nNovember -- above the 50-threshold that separates growth from \ncontraction. Analysts had forecast a reading of 49.9. \"That makes the general economy look steadier and even \nfirmer than it was thought to be,\" said Pierre Ellis, senior \neconomist at Decision Economics in New York.\n INFLATION PRESSURES MODERATING Analysts were also encouraged by the decline in the ISM's \nprices paid index, which measures inflation pressures at the \nindustrial level. The index fell to 47.5 from 53.5, while a \nmeasure of new orders climbed to 52.1 from 48.7. \"The fact the price index is down is good news,\" said \nRobert MacIntosh, chief economist at Eaton Vance Management in \nBoston. However, for the Fed the overall index is \"a small \npiece of data but everything else being equal, this would make \nthem hold off from a cut.\" The data was seen as further confirmation that the Fed \nwould probably hold interest rates unchanged well into the \nfirst half of 2007. The central bank raised its target for the federal funds \nrate 17 times to 5.25 percent between June 2004 and June 2006. \nAnalysts expect it to start easing monetary policy sometime \nthis year. The next policy-setting meeting for the Fed is \nscheduled for the end of the month. A major component of factory output appeared to stabilize \nin December according to sales figures on Wednesday. Paul \nBallew, General Motor's chief sales analyst said the industry's \nU.S. light vehicle sales in December ran at an annual adjusted \nrate of 16.9 million, while sales for 2006 are estimated down \nabout 2.3 percent to 16.7 million. Construction spending also pointed to a resilient economy. \nSpending fell 0.2 percent in November, led by an eighth \nstraight drop in private residential building that more than \noffset record highs in nonresidential and public construction.\n HOUSING MARKET RESLIENT More current data showed some resilience in the U.S. \nhousing market. Mortgage applications rose last week, led by \ndemand for home purchase loans even as interest rates climbed \nfor a fourth consecutive week, an industry trade group said. The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally \nadjusted index of mortgage application activity, which includes \nboth refinance and purchase loans, rose 3.6 percent last week. But analysts were cautious on the economy and pointed to a \nreport that showed U.S. private sector employment contracted in \nDecember for the first time since April 2003. The monthly ADP National Employment Report showed private \nsector employers shed 40,000 jobs after adding 158,000 jobs in \nNovember. The report is based on payroll data and measures the \nchange in total private sector nonfarm employment each month. \"The ADP number suggests we are only starting to feel the \nimpact of a slower economy,\" said Boris Schlossberg, senior \ncurrency strategist at Forex Capital Markets in New York. The ADP report hinted the government's closely watched \nnonfarm payrolls report for December, due on Friday, might \nprove soft, although economists debate the extent of the \ncorrelation between the two reports. \"This is a big surprise. ... There is no evidence of \nsystematic problems in the ADP survey,\" said Ian Shepherdson, \nchief U.S. economist at High Frequency economics in New York. He said his firm would cut its estimate for the Labor \nDepartment's report to 75,000 jobs created, from an original \nestimate of 100,000. \"ADP is not perfect and is sometimes horribly wrong, but it \nis the best of a bad bunch of payroll indicators and cannot be \ncompletely ignored.\" According to the latest Reuters poll, Economists expect \nFriday's report show 110,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added in \nDecember, slowing from a 132,000 gain in November.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/04/businesspro-usa-economy-dc-idUSN0339794520070104", "sectors": [["U.S., ", "Bonds"]], "title": "factories rebound , fed cites growth concerns"},
{"date": "18:57 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " (Recasts first paragraph; adds quotes, details) By Jui ChakravortyDETROIT Jan 3 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp. became one of\nthe Big Three automakers in 2006, using its strong December\nU.S. sales to oust DaimlerChrysler from the fabled troika. Toyota (7203.T) overtook DaimlerChrysler for the No. 3 spot\nin sales in the U.S. market for all of 2006 as it continued to\ntake share from U.S. automakers whose critical truck sales\nclosed the year on a down note. December U.S. sales at General Motors Corp. (GM.N) and Ford\nMotor Co. (F.N) fell about 10 percent each, when adjusted for\nan extra selling day a year earlier. DaimlerChrysler AG's\nDCXGn.DE Chrysler unit was the lone U.S. automaker to post\ngains with adjusted sales rising 4 percent. Toyota's sales rose more than 16 percent, driven by strong\ndemand for its Corolla and Camry sedans. Its December figures\nbring full-year sales to 2.54 million, surpassing\nDaimlerChrysler's 2.39 million. Toyota is expected to overtake GM as the world's largest\nautomaker in 2007 and take second place in the United States. \"(Toyota) will be No. 2 in 2007,\" said Alex Rosten, an\nindustry analyst with Edmunds.com. \"Ford has even conceded the\nfact that Toyota is going to overtake them as the No. 2\nautomaker in North America.\" Ford said sales were hurt by a 21 percent decline in sales\nof F-series pickup trucks -- its top-selling vehicle. Explorer\nsports utility vehicle (SUV) sales fell 29.5 percent. Overall\ntruck sales were down 14 percent due to higher gas prices and a\nsoft housing market. \"The (truck) segment will still continue to be under\npressure ... at least in the early part of 2007,\" Ford sales\nanalyst George Pipas said on a call. \"The new products will\nhelp offset some of the softness we are seeing in housing.\" Ford's car sales fell almost 10 percent. The combined monthly U.S. market share for Detroit's Big\nThree is estimated to be 54.3 percent in December, down from\n56.6 percent a year earlier, according to Edmunds.com. Honda Motor Co. Ltd. (7267.T) said U.S. December sales rose\n3 percent and Nissan North America Co. Ltd. (7201.T) said sales\nwere up 4.4 percent, driven by demand for its new Altima,\nSentra and Versa cars. Asian automakers have gained ground this year as consumers\nshifted away from larger, gas-guzzling SUVs to smaller sports\nutility models or cars. Toyota, Nissan, Honda and Hyundai Motor Co. Ltd.\n(005380.KS) have relied on cars in the U.S. market, while\ndomestic automakers have focused on larger SUVs and trucks,\nwhich account for at least 60 percent of their sales. Industry-wide sales ran at an annualized rate of 16.8\nmillion vehicles for December, in line with analysts's\nestimates and down from 17.1 million a year earlier. GM'S TRANSACTION PRICE UP GM's average U.S. transaction price on vehicles rose 8\npercent in December from the prior year, a top company official\ntold reporters and analysts on Wednesday. Paul Ballew, GM's chief sales analyst, said transaction\nprices were up 7 percent during the fourth quarter and up 2\npercent for 2006. \"They held the line on incentives and their transaction\nprices actually improved,\" Rosten said of GM, which is in the\nmiddle of a broad restructuring after losing $10.6 billion in\n2005. \"Lower sales volume isn't necessarily a bad thing if you\nare making more money per unit,\" Rosten said, adding that GM\nhad spent the least per vehicle on incentives since April\n2002. The Big Three are all cutting production as they try to\nalign capacity with demand. GM on Wednesday cut its first-\nquarter production forecast by 20,000 to 1.120 million\nvehicles, saying it was to reduce low-margin daily rental fleet\nsales. GM had also cut its 2006 fourth-quarter production by 13\npercent, while Ford forecast a 22 percent cut and Chrysler\nreduced second-half production by as much as 17 percent. JP Morgan analyst Himanshu Patel expects GM will likely cut\nproduction further in 2007. \"GM ended with 1.05 million units in inventory, roughly\nflat with last year, and could still hold risks for 07\nproduction,\" Patel said in a note to clients.\n  (Additional reporting by Poornima Gupta in Detroit and David\nBailey in Chicago)\n\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/autos-sales-idUSN0342312520070103", "sectors": [], "title": "update 2 - toyota joined the big three in 2006"},

(HD.N) that gave its departing boss a $210 million\ngoodbye. Wachtell's work for Home Depot marks the third time in\nrecent years that it gave advice to boards during other large\npayout controversies, including executive ousters at Morgan\nStanley (MS.N) and the New York Stock Exchange NYX.N. Home Depot confirmed Wachtell is representing its board.\nWachtell, a respected New York city corporate law firm led by\nprominent takeover attorney Martin Lipton, did not respond to a\ncall seeking comment on Home Depot. The home improvement retailer said on Wednesday that\nChairman and Chief Executive Robert Nardelli had resigned after\na year of heavy criticism of the company's underperformance and\nNardelli's pay package. The company also found past problems\nwith its stock option grants. Nardelli's $210 million exit package sparked widespread\ncriticism and thrust Wachtell back in the CEO pay spotlight. Martin Lipton was also chairman of the legal-advisory\ncommittee of the NYSE, where former Chairman Richard Grasso was\nforced out in 2003 after a furor over his $187.5 million pay\npackage. Home Depot co-founder and board director Kenneth Langone\nchaired the NYSE's compensation committee at the time of\nGrasso's pay flap. Wachtell advised Morgan Stanley's board at the time when\nits former CEO, Philip Purcell, was forced out at the end of\nJune 2005 in the wake of management turmoil, legal setbacks and\nthe loss of many top bankers and traders. Purcell was awarded a\nseparation payment of $44 million.

The coalition of 24 manufacturers and retailers will launch\nthe television and print campaign, costing 4 million pounds ($8\nmillion), beginning Jan. 8, following government pressure for\naction on food labels to help fight obesity. However, the advertisements will promote a labeling system\nof guideline daily amounts (GDAs) of salt, sugar and fat that\ngoes head-to-head with the Food Standard Agency's official\ncampaign promoting \"traffic light\" labeling. The color-code system recommended by the agency proved too\nmuch for many food manufacturers and retailers who have baulked\nat slapping red \"stop sign\" logos on the front their colas,\nchocolate bars and breakfast cereals. \"This isn't just about a label, it's about a lifestyle. We\nhave made it simple to compare what's inside thousands of\nevery-day foods so you can choose what best suits your diet,\"\nGDA campaign director Jane Holdsworth said in a statement. Food labeling is a hot topic in the developed world with\nspiraling obesity and associated illness putting huge strain on\nmedical services. One million British children are forecast to be obese by\n2010 and the UK's creaking national health service has said it\nwill have difficulty coping with that rise. The campaign, which will run for 18 months and has divided\nthe British industry, is the biggest joint initiative ever by\nthe food industry with GDA labels added to nearly 40 percent of\nUK retail food and drink packs, Holdsworth said. The voluntary traffic-light plan, promoted by the Food\nAgency, which says it is easier to understand, has won backing\nof national grocers J. Sainsbury (SBRY.L), Waitrose, Wal-Mart's\nAsda (WMT.N), Marks and Spencer (MKS.L) and McCain. Tesco (TSCO.L), Britain's biggest retailer that has led the\ncalls for GDA food labeling, has 4,000 products already under\nthe plan and will be marking up thousands more. \"All moves to improve labeling have to applauded. But our\nscheme works best for us and our customers. It's simpler, it's\npractical. You can plan your whole daily diet more easily,\"\nTesco Chief Executive Terry Leahy said last year.

He also wrote a rare opinion article in The Wall Street Journal promoting his new strategy for Iraq to be announced in coming days.Bush called upon Democrats to set aside politics, but Democrats, who are preparing to flex their muscle with a legislative push when they take command of Congress on Thursday, responded cautiously.\"We hope that when the president says compromise, it means more than 'do it my way,' which is what he's meant in the past,\" said New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer.\"I'm encouraged that President Bush said today that he wants to work in bipartisanship, and I hope he means it,\" said incoming Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada.In his White House comments, Bush said he would present a five-year plan to Congress next month that would balance the budget by 2012 -- three years after his presidency ends -- and make lower tax rates permanent.Bush called on Congress to reform the process in which billions of dollars in individual spending items, known as \"earmarks,\" for specific congressional districts are able to get approved without a vote.Balancing the budget in that time frame would require substantial spending discipline, given that recent projections by the White House showed it expected a budget gap of $127 billion by 2011.In early February, Congress expects Bush to request about $100 billion in additional \"emergency\" funds to pay for combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. The wars currently are being funded with $70 billion put into the pipeline a few months ago.\"We welcome the president's newfound commitment to a balanced budget, but his comments make us wary,\" said incoming House Budget Committee Chairman John Spratt of South Carolina. \"They suggest that his budget will still embody the policies that led to the largest deficits in history.\"Bush also wrote in a rare opinion article in The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that his new strategy for Iraq would help the \"people gain control of the security situation and hasten the day when the Iraqi government gains full control over its affairs.\"\"We now have the opportunity to build a bipartisan consensus to fight and win the war,\" he wrote.NEW IRAQ STRATEGYBush is to announce a new strategy for Iraq as early as Tuesday and he is considering a short-term increase of thousands of U.S. troops to try to bring stability to Baghdad.The White House described him as \"narrowing the choices\" and said he was focusing on a package of options that included \"the military front, the economic front and the political front\" to announce as a whole.Bush has two years left in office and believes he can accomplish some of his legislative agenda, even though his Republican Party has lost control of the House of Representatives and the Senate and Americans are increasingly turning their attention to the 2008 race to succeed him.(Additional reporting by Glenn Somerville, Richard Cowan and Thomas Ferraro)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/04/us-bush-cabinet-idUSN0233813220070104", "sectors": [["Politics"]], "title": "bush seeks backing for agenda on budget , iraq"},
{"date": "19:03 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "WASHINGTON Jan 3 As the first wave of U.S.\nbaby boomers prepares to retire, the U.S. Treasury is hoping to\nsave millions of dollars by persuading them to receive their\nSocial Security benefits by direct deposit. The Treasury and the Federal Reserve Banks are launching a\nyear-long campaign to boost direct deposit use, hoping that\ntechnology-savvy boomers would make the switch from paper\nchecks. The Treasury estimates that it costs 80 cents more to\nprocess a paper benefit check than a direct deposit payment,\nincluding postage, processing costs and claims costs related to\nfraud and check replacements. In 2006 alone, more than 57,000 Treasury-issued checks --\nrepresenting $54 million in estimated value -- were forged. \"About 98 percent of payment problems are related to paper\nchecks,\" said Alvina McHale, public affairs director for the\nTreasury's Financial Management Service. If each of the 154 million benefit checks mailed out in\n2006 had been converted to direct deposit, the federal\ngovernment would have saved around $123 million, McHale said. And with the first of the 77 million baby boomers born\nbetween 1946 and 1964 becoming eligible to receive Social\nSecurity benefits in 2008, when they turn 62, the check numbers\nare expected to rise dramatically in coming years. In a national survey released on Wednesday, the Treasury\nfound that baby boomers were more than twice as likely as\ntoday's senior citizens to bank and pay bills online. But direct deposit use among today's seniors actually\noutpaces that of baby boomers. The survey found that 25 percent\nof baby boomers still get paid by their employers with paper\nchecks, compared to only 13 percent for those aged 61 or\nolder. And only 18 percent of older baby boomers aged 51-60 said\nthey were likely to enroll in direct deposit in the next year,\ncompared to 30 percent of baby boomers overall. The older\nboomers also were less likely to bank online, with 36 percent\nusing such facilities compared to 56 percent for those aged\n42-50. While recent indicators show the national savings rate is\ndeclining, the poll showed that only 16 percent of baby boomers\nsay all or most of their future retirement income will come\nfrom Social Security. In comparison, twice as many (31 percent)\nof existing retirees say Social Security makes up all or most\nof their income. The poll also found boomers more likely to wait to collect\ntheir Social Security retirement benefits. About 16 percent of boomers who are not yet retired plan to\nstart collecting Social Security at age 62, according to the\npoll, compared with 34 percent of current retirees who started\ncollecting benefits at that age.\n\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/04/usa-treasury-deposits-idUSN0344044220070104", "sectors": [], "title": "us treasury sees savings in boomer direct deposits"},

The offensive came three weeks after Calderon sent 7,000 troops to his crime-ridden home state of Michoacan to kick off a new war on drug-related violence that killed some 2,000 people in 2006.\"We are determined to regain security, not just in Michoacan or Baja California, but in every part of Mexico that is threatened by organized crime,\" Calderon said on Wednesday, visiting troops in Michoacan, in western Mexico.Calderon took office on December 1.Tijuana, just south of San Diego and one of the busiest border crossings into the United States, sees a murder almost every day and two kidnappings a week, most blamed on brutal rivalries between drug cartels.The city's drug trade is dominated by the Arellano Felix cartel, which battles rival gangs from the northwestern state of Sinaloa.Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora said there was evidence criminal gangs had infiltrated the local police.\"This is about getting Tijuana out of the hands of criminal organizations,\" he told Reuters.Huge quantities of South American cocaine pass through Mexico on its way to the United States, and Mexico also produces marijuana, methamphetamines and heroin.Mexico's municipal police are so poorly paid and badly equipped that even officers not in the pay of crime gangs are widely considered inept.Calderon's predecessor Vicente Fox declared war on drug gangs in early 2005, but the crackdown only intensified turf wars between cartels. Gang-related murders and drive-by shootings spread down Mexico's Pacific coast.In one grisly incident last year, five severed heads were tossed onto the dance floor of a Michoacan nightclub.Calderon said the war on drug gangs -- whom local media blame for half of all federal crimes -- had to be accompanied by improvements to the justice system, which is also criticized as ineffective and corrupt.\"We need laws that help us chase and imprison criminals, not ones that save them from the punishment they deserve,\" he said.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/04/us-mexico-drugs-idUSN0343503820070104", "sectors": [["World"]], "title": "mexico troops enter tijuana in drug gang crackdown"},

(HD.N) Chairman and \nChief Executive Robert Nardelli abruptly left the company after \na year of heavy criticism of everything from his pay package to \nthe underperforming retailer's corporate governance. Nardelli, 58, will walk away with a severance package of \nabout $210 million under terms of his employment. He and the \ncompany said in a release that his leaving was a \"mutual \ndecision,\" and Home Depot shares rose more than 2 percent. Succeeding Nardelli is Frank Blake, the 57-year-old vice \nchairman who joined Atlanta-based Home Depot in 2002. The moves \nof Nardelli and Blake, both former General Electric Co. (GE.N) \nexecutives, took effect on Tuesday, the retailer said. Wall Street cheered the leadership change. Many analysts \nsaid that although Nardelli improved operations at the world's \nlargest home improvement retailer, recent unfavorable publicity \ndented confidence in Home Depot as it faces a slowing housing \nmarket and competition from rival Lowe's Cos. (LOW.N) \"I just think it's a sign that just from a morale \nstandpoint and a confidence standpoint ... from investors, from \nemployees, from the market, they needed to make a change,\" said \nJon Fisher, a portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset \nManagement, which owns Home Depot shares.\n BLAKE Many analysts said Blake, who played a key role in Home \nDepot's expansion into Mexico and a recent purchase in China, \nwas a better consensus builder, but added his lack of retail \nexperience was a drawback as store sales weaken. Blake \"has never run a company or one of Home Depot's major \noperating businesses,\" Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Fassler \nsaid in a research note. Home Depot also named Joe DeAngelo, head of its growing \nsupply division geared to contractors, to the new post of chief \noperating officer and gave added duties to finance chief Carol \nTome. The company said its board was confident about the current \nbusiness model and long-term strategy, which includes a push to \nexpand sales to contractor markets. Home Depot also said it waived the retirement age of 72 for \ndirectors John Clendenin, Claudio Gonzalez and Milledge A. Hart \nIII and asked them to stand for re-election at the 2007 annual \nmeeting.\n PILE ON Nardelli, one of the three executives in the running to \nsucceed GE chief Jack Welch years ago, came to Home Depot in \nlate 2000 with much fanfare, but drew mixed reviews from \nworkers and some on Wall Street who expressed concern over his \nlack of retailing experience. In recent years, Nardelli drew fire from critics who \ncharged his pay was out of line with company performance. Home \nDepot's stock has fallen more than 8 percent since Nardelli \narrived, but he has earned at least $119 million in salary and \nbonus during that time. Late last year, after headlines over Nardelli's pay, the \nboard's no-show at the May annual meeting, a federal probe into \ncompany stock-option grant practices and weakening sales and \nearnings, activist Home Depot investors became more emboldened, \nand takeover rumors sprouted. \"You always had the feeling you were very unwelcome\" at \nannual meetings run by Nardelli, said corporate gadfly Evelyn \nY. Davis, who owns stock in Home Depot and many other \ncompanies. Ralph Whitworth, founder and principal at San Diego-based \nRelational Investors, said in mid-December that he was \naccumulating Home Depot stock and planned to nominate at least \ntwo directors for election at the retailer's 2007 annual \nmeeting. Relational previously led a proxy battle at Sovereign \nBancorp Inc. SOV.N and eventually took a seat on that \ncompany's board. Longtime shareholder Laborers' International Union of North \nAmerica called on Home Depot to require investor approval of \n\"extraordinary\" benefits for officers, and said Nardelli's $210 \nmillion severance package was \"obscene.\" The AFL-CIO union urged the retailer to freeze all payments \nto Nardelli and seek the resignation of lead director Kenneth \nLangone, who was sued over the pay package of former New York \nStock Exchange chief Richard Grasso. Nardelli's exit package includes cash severance of $20 \nmillion, unvested deferred stock awards of about $77 million \nand other payments, Home Depot said. Home Depot shares, which rose 91 cents, or 2.3 percent, to \n$41.07 on Wednesday, have risen about 4 percent since early \nJune, and had rallied in recent weeks on takeover speculation.

Part of the proceeds will go to pay a debt owed to the storage company in keeping with court order,\" Houston's publicist, Nancy Seltzer, said in a statement.\"It is not unusual for an artist to sell off old equipment and costumes no longer needed,\" she said, giving no details on how much Houston owes the warehouse.Houston filed for divorce from Brown in September after 14 tumultuous years of marriage and tabloid headlines.More than 400 lots are listed for sale, including pianos, keyboards, organs, drums, designer hats, shoes and outfits from well-known names such as Giorgio Armani, Jean Paul Gaultier, Pamela Dennis, Gianni Versace and Dolce & Gabbana.Among the more intriguing items are \"Whitney's Throne\" chair, a designer Lucite cocktail stand and a church pew.The daughter of gospel singer Cissy Houston and cousin of pop star Dionne Warwick, Houston shot to fame with her 1983 debut album and won several Grammy awards over the next decade.She also found success as an actress, appearing opposite Kevin Costner in \"The Bodyguard.\" She and Brown also starred in television reality show \"Being Bobby Brown.\"Houston largely retreated from performing after the release of her 1999 album, \"My Love is Your Love,\" but surfaced alongside Brown in the tabloids, which have long reported details of their stormy marriage.In 2000, security guards in Hawaii found marijuana in the couple's luggage. Two years later Houston admitted in an ABC interview that she had used drugs in the past. Twice subsequently she has entered treatment for drugs.Brown also has had run-ins with the law, including arrests for drug possession, assault and drunken driving.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/04/us-houston-auction-idUSN0327627820070104", "sectors": [["U.S., ", "Entertainment, ", "People"]], "title": "whitney houston to auction off clothes to pay debt"},
{"date": "02:34 02 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "NEW YORK The Washington Post Co. plans to have \nits veteran editors help shape the way stories appear on the \nWeb in the latest example of how top U.S. publishers are \nretooling news operations for the Internet. The Washington Post's Web site, launched more than a decade \nago, has been a bellwether among online news publishers because \nof its early success at attracting readers online and growing \nadvertising. While many newspapers beef up their Internet sites to meet \na growing migration of readership to the Web, their print and \nWeb production operations remain mostly separate divisions. The Post for example produces and packages its Web news \nwith employees who work across the Potomac River from \nWashington, D.C., in Arlington, Virginia. Starting in January, print editors will \"help us at the Web \nsite and at the paper think smartly about more \nthree-dimensional ways that you can present that news,\" Post \nExecutive Editor Leonard Downie Jr. told Reuters. Newspaper editors have traditionally focused on assigning \nand editing articles, as well as questions of layout, such as \nwhere a story sits on a print page, the tenor and size of its \nheadline or its relation to a photograph. Web news also requires expertise in updating breaking \nstories through the day, drawing attention to human interest or \nfeature stories as well as ensuring reporters make it a \npriority to add video, audio or commentary to the page. That integration is key to the future of newspapers, as \nInternet advertising is often their fastest growing segment, \nrising 30 to 60 percent annually, depending on the publisher, \neven as print ad rates and circulation declines. \"The majority of their audience is now online,\" said Jeff \nJarvis, media consultant and publisher of the Buzzmachine blog. \n\"They have to serve that audience where that audience is.\" Some have cut hundreds of jobs, narrowed their print page \nwidth or consolidated production plants to save costs. Others \nface shareholder pressure to improve returns or sell assets.\n NEW ROLE FOR NEWSROOMS In the meantime, many newspaper stocks are sharply \nunderperforming the wider market as the pace of Internet \nearnings has yet to compensate for slower print growth. Washington Post stock has dropped 1.1 percent since the \nstart of 2006, the New York Times has lost 10.4 percent and \nMcClatchy Co. has shed nearly 27 percent, compared with a 14 \npercent rise in the benchmark S&P 500 Index. Companies aiming to bridge the gap with their own Web \noperations include USA Today publisher Gannett Co. Inc., which \nis reshaping newsrooms at nearly 90 local papers to emphasize \nWeb and print news editions as equally important. More publishers anticipate similar changes to their \noperations, trying to push sometimes reluctant print staff to \noutline how they will do their jobs in the future. Dow Jones & Co. is relying on its Dow Jones Newswires \nservice for much of its daily coverage, focusing on exclusive \nstories and analysis for its Wall Street Journal newspaper. The \nNew York Times last year said it would integrate its Web and \nprint operations. \"All of the desks here to varying degrees are becoming much \nmore active about ... advising their reporters to call in to \nthe continuous news desk or file their stories to us,\" said \nNeil Chase, editor at the Times' continuous news desk that \nassembles breaking news throughout the day. The Post has a similar division whose reporters and editors \nhandle breaking stories for the Web, but that thinking has not \npenetrated to all levels of the print edition. \"The news section sometimes can use the continuous news \ndesk as a crutch rather than finding ways themselves to make \nthat news happen,\" said Washingtonpost.com editor Liz Spayd, \nformer assistant managing editor of the paper's national news \ndesk. The ideal, she said, would be for section editors to \napproach their jobs as, \"I'm not going to just think about like \nhow it happens on the paper, but on the Web and every \nplatform.\" She said the role of newspaper editors in building Web news \nwill not take responsibility away from current Internet staff.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/04/industry-washingtonpost-web-dc-idUSN2925910120070104", "sectors": [["Tech"]], "title": "washington post aims for closer print , web ties"},

{"date": "22:04 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "DETROIT Ford Motor Co. (F.N) is heading into the new year with a highly regarded chief executive, $48 billion in cash, a new crossover utility vehicle expected to prove a hit and the projected savings from the departure of a third of its work force.Then there is the bad news: the automaker is mortgaged to the hilt, struggling with the legacy of wobbly product plans and banking on its third turnaround plan in the last five years to deliver sustained profitability.With Ford poised to lose its No. 2 spot in the U.S. market to Toyota Motor Corp. (7203.T) in 2007, analysts are weighing the potential payoffs of Ford's painful restructuring against the risk posed by its heavy borrowing.For now, the pessimism on Wall Street is waning, but analysts caution that it will at least two years before a recovery shows signs of traction.\"Ford is a deep turnaround situation,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Jonathan Steinmetz said in a recent note for clients.But the building blocks are forming, said Steinmetz, who sees sustainable positive cash flow from Ford's auto operations as still four years away.A key reason for a turn in Wall Street sentiment is Ford's new chief executive, Alan Mulally, a restructuring expert who was lured away from Boeing Co. (BA.N) in September.Since Mulally took over from Ford family scion Bill Ford Jr. in October, he has moved to streamline management, appointed a global product chief and raised about $25 billion in cash through liens, bond offerings and credit lines.The company has also reached out to Toyota, the increasingly dominant Japanese automaker, which eagerly studied Ford in the 1930s when it was a maker of looms branching out to manufacture cars.Analysts say Mulally's trip to Tokyo earlier this month to meet Toyota Chairman Fujio Cho might prompt a partnership that would help Ford bring down costs in areas such as parts procurement, technology development and planned plant closures.\"You have to ask yourself what would be in it for Toyota. They are doing pretty well on their own. They are on their way to becoming the world's largest automaker next year (2007),\" said IRN Inc. analyst Erich Merkle.\"But a joint venture might work. There are some real possibilities there.\"Even before Mulally's trip to Toyota, Wall Street analysts had been growing more cautiously optimistic.Merrill Lynch analyst John Murphy raised his rating on Ford stock to \"neutral\" from \"sell,\" citing the company's cash position of $48.3 billion, up from $23.6 billion at the end of September.Steinmetz of Morgan Stanley also raised his rating on Ford to \"overweight\" from \"equal-weight.\"\"While this is not a one-man story, new leadership is a part of our call,\" Steinmetz said in a note for clients.Ford's revised \"Way Forward\" restructuring, announced in mid-September, disappointed investors and touched off a sharp sell-off of its shares by steering clear of asset sales and failing to address the company's liquidity position. But Ford's current cash position has eased some of those concerns.Brett Hoselton, analyst with Keybanc Securities, forecasts that the rapid deterioration of earnings in 2006 should end in 2007 as Ford generates more than $4 billion in savings -- most of it in 2007 -- from employee departures.PRODUCT PIPELINE, MARKET SHARE RISKSEveryone agrees, however, that Ford is still in a precarious situation and 2007 is going to be a tough year.Ford's overall U.S. sales, unadjusted for the number of selling days, slipped 13 percent in December and 8 percent for 2006, partly because of lower demand for its best-selling F-Series pickup trucks.The company's stock fell 2.72 percent in 2006 and is down 50 percent since early 2005, when its most recent downturn began.Ford lost $7 billion through September of last year with further losses forecast in the October-December period quarter and beyond. By Ford's own estimate, its North American unit will lose money until 2009 and run through $17 billion cash in the next three years.The key risk, according to most analysts, is Ford's weak product pipeline at a time when rivals are pushing ahead.\"If you look out through 2009, they don't have any new small-car products coming out,\" said AMR Research analyst Kevin Reale. \"Most of the products are basically refacing of SUVs and small trucks.\"Ford launched its new Edge crossover SUV in December and is gearing up for the arrival of three revamped vehicles in 2007 -- the SuperDuty pickup truck, Focus sedan and Escape SUV. The company also has a larger crossover vehicle in the pipeline that will be based on its Fairlane concept car.Ford is aiming to hold its overall share of the U.S. light-vehicle market at 14 percent or more from over 17 percent as it restructures by shutting 16 plants and cutting more than 50,000 jobs.\"If the company loses 4 more points of U.S. market share instead of the 2.5 points we are expecting, the turnaround is much tougher, perhaps impossible,\" Steinmetz said.(For other stories in the series, go to here)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/04/us-autoshow-ford-idUSN2038497420070104", "sectors": [], "title": "ford seen still in crisis but pessimism wanes"},

(HD.N) made him, and the retailer, a favorite target of shareholder activists. Now, his exit package is giving critics a new round of ammunition.Nardelli stepped down from his job as chairman and chief executive on Wednesday, walking away with about $210 million in a severance deal -- the equivalent of about $96,000 for every day of his 6-year tenure.The payout comes on top of earnings of at least $119.2 million in salary and bonus, not including options, that Nardelli, 58, collected as CEO through the end of fiscal 2006.All the while, Home Depot shares lost nearly 8 percent of their value during Nardelli's tenure.\"He should be giving money back, not taking more money out,\" said Nell Minow, co-founder of The Corporate Library, a research group that rates companies' governance practices. \"Performance has been poor and he has been hugely overpaid every step of the way.\"Investor activists have a long list of complaints over how Home Depot is run -- and they say the board should have cut a much less generous exit deal with Nardelli.The Atlanta-based company has been under pressure amid weakening sales and profits and it faces a regulatory probe into its stock options award practices. It drew particular wrath last year when board members skipped the 2006 annual meeting amid criticism of Nardelli's compensation.\"The golden parachute he's been given is not acceptable to shareholders,\" said Richard Ferlauto, director or pension and benefit policy at the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees, a union umbrella group that has been critical of executive compensation.The AFL-CIO on Wednesday called on Home Depot to freeze all payments to Nardelli until the company can determine whether the compensation pact was properly entered into and whether the former CEO \"complied with his obligations under those agreements.\"The union group also called for the resignation of lead director Kenneth Langone, who was sued by the New York attorney general's office over the pay package of former New York Stock Exchange chairman Richard Grasso in a separate case. The group said it also wants further disclosure from the company about the findings of an internal probe into the timing of stock options awards.Janna Sampson, a fund manager at OakBrook Investments outside Chicago that holds about 513,000 Home Depot shares, said the board likely had little choice but to give Nardelli the large payout -- as his severance terms were outlined in his employment agreement.The company is paying a \"pretty steep price\" to get rid of Nardelli, she said. But Home Depot \"may be trying to remove what had become kind of a block to moving forward.\"Some politicians were quick to weigh in on the exit package. Nardelli's severance is \"further confirmation of the need to deal with a pattern of CEO pay that appears to be out of control,\" said U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.MONEY, MONEY, MONEYHome Depot isn't the only company that's come under criticism recently for payouts to outgoing chiefs.Ex-Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) CEO Hank McKinnell, who was replaced following a steep decline in the company's market value, will get about $198 million upon his departure.Meanwhile, shareholder watchdogs say they are awaiting details of how much the new Home Depot chief, 57-year-old Vice Chairman Frank Blake, will be paid. Both Nardelli and Blake were formerly executives at General Electric Co. (GE.N).\"My guess is the pay package (for Blake) is not going to be high profile -- his package will probably be more run of the mill,\" said Joseph Carcello, director of research at the University of Tennessee's Corporate Governance Center.The company's board, he said, has been shown that \"you need to align the compensation more closely with the returns to stockholders.\"But Minow, of the Corporate Library, which gives Home Depot an \"F\" grade for overall governance practices, says that it won't be clear if the board has learned its lessons until the specifics of the new CEO's pay package are released.\"We will get a chance to see if they have learned from their mistakes,\" she said. \"Based on this departure package, it looks like they haven't.\"(Additional reporting by Joseph Giannone)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/04/us-homedepot-nardelli-exitpackage-idUSN0340057220070104", "sectors": [], "title": "home depot still needs to learn lessons , critics say"},

The sleekly designed campus, sprawling 52 acres in a sleepy \ncommunity south of Johannesburg, encompasses classrooms and \nlaboratories equipped with flat screen computers, a yoga \nstudio, beauty salon and well-stocked library. \"When you educate a girl you begin to change the face of a \nnation,\" said Winfrey. \"The school is going to change the \ntrajectory of their lives.\" She said the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls was \ninspired by her own humble beginnings, struggling to survive \nwith no electricity or running water, and as a former victim of \nphysical and sexual abuse. Former South African president Nelson Mandela, on hand for \nthe opening celebration, praised Winfrey. \"This is not a distant donation you've made but a project \nthat is clearly close to your heart,\" Mandela said. \"South Africa should take a lesson from you about what \npersonal commitment means.\" American singers Mariah Carey, Tina Turner and Mary J. \nBlige, comedian Chris Rock, actor Sydney Poitier and filmmaker \nSpike Lee attended the star-studded school launch.\n FAILING SCHOOLS \"The future is so bright for them it burns my eyes.

Activists criticize the South African government for \nneglecting public schools particularly in poor and rural areas \nwhere classrooms are often overcrowded and inadequately funded. High levels of classroom violence, teenage pregnancy and \ndrug abuse exacerbate the poor standard of education. Winfrey said she hoped a better education could shield \nSouth Africa girls from contracting HIV, a disease that affects \nan estimated 5.5 million of South Africa's 45 million people. \"Girls who are educated are less likely to get HIV/AIDS, \nand in this country which has such a pandemic, we have to begin \nto change the pandemic,\" she said. While authorities seek to expand a program to waive school \nfees for some of the poorest South Africans, many believe that \nthe legacy of apartheid-era laws remain a disadvantage for \nunderprivileged black students.

The first batch of 152 mostly black students, chosen from \nthousands of applicants, will eventually be followed by another \n300 girls between Grades 7 and 12, Winfrey said. Admission criteria mean the family of each girl must earn \nless than 60,000 rand ($8,663) annually to get their foot in \nthe door. After that, pupils were hand-picked by Winfrey for \ndisplaying strong leadership qualities in interviews. Tuition and board is free at the residential school. \"Where we live there are lots of gangsters and I want to \nchange all of that,\" Noxolo Buthelezi, 13, said in her new \nschool uniform -- a forest green pleated skirt and jacket and \ncollared white shirt.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/04/people-safrica-winfrey-education-dc-idUSL023073220070104", "sectors": [["Entertainment, ", "People"]], "title": "oprah opens academy for poor girls in south africa"},

In a statement issued last month, A&M Records said, \"It is our intention to mark the anniversary by doing something special with the band's catalog of songs. Needless to say, everyone is hopeful the band will support our plans and while early discussions have taken place, nothing has been decided.\"Sources say in addition to DVD releases, A&M is planning another multi-disc collection in the vein of 1993's \"Message in a Box,\" which featured the band's complete studio recordings and a handful of rarities.A Police reunion has been the concert industry's dream for two decades, as it is believed the band could play stadiums internationally should it choose to reunite. But besides an impromptu set at Sting's 1992 wedding to Trudie Styler, the Police's only other post-breakup performance was in celebration of its 2003 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.And while Sting has repeatedly expressed reluctance at reuniting, drummer Stewart Copeland and guitarist Andy Summers have kept the flame alive. This summer, Summers told Billboard he was certain the group could have continued past its 1983 commercial peak with \"Synchronicity.\"\"The more rational approach would have been, 'OK, Sting, go make a solo record, and let's get back together in two or three years,'\" he said. \"I'm certain we could have done that.

{"date": "22:58 01 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " NEW YORK (Billboard) - Billboard presents a look at the \nmusic you'll be hearing a lot about in the first quarter:\n JOHN MELLENCAMP \"Freedom's Road\" (Universal, January 23) Mellencamp's first album of originals since 2001 is led by \n\"Our Country,\" which has been prominently featured in a \nChevrolet commercial to the chagrin of his label. In November, \nthe track earned Mellencamp his first appearance on The \nBillboard Hot 100 in nine years and just the third of his \ncareer on Hot Country Songs. \"'Our Country' is the most John Mellencamp-sounding record \non it,\" he says. \"I think people are gonna go, 'Wow!,' or \nthey're gonna go, 'What is he trying to do?\"' Elsewhere, Joan \nBaez duets with Mellencamp on the track \"Jim Crow.\"\n THE SHINS \"Wincing the Night Away\" (Sub Pop, January 23) Natalie Portman's character in the 2004 film \"Garden State\" \nproclaimed \"the Shins will change your life,\" which the \nPortland, Ore., indie-pop darlings hope to do with their third \nSub Pop album, originally due last summer. \"I'm constantly reminded of how much better the project \ngets as new discoveries are made,\" frontman James Mercer says. \n\"That only happens through taking your time and being able to \napproach it with some new perspective.\" Indeed, \"Wincing\" advances the band well beyond the simple \nindie pop of its first two albums, the most recent of which, \n2003's \"Chutes Too Narrow,\" has sold 407,000 copies in the \nUnited States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Highlights include \"Turn on Me,\" which nearly nicks the \nmelody of the girl-group classic \"Then He Kissed Me\"; \"Black \nWave,\" a ghostly slice of acoustic folk that never releases its \ntension; and the jammed-out opener \"Sleeping Lessons.\"\n NORAH JONES \"Not Too Late\" (Blue Note, January 30) Norah Jones kept a low profile in 2006, recording a \ncollaborative album with New York-based musician friends as the \nLittle Willies and guesting on the self-titled Ipecac album \nfrom Mike Patton's Peeping Tom project. But January 30 sees her back in the public eye with her \nthird album, \"Not Too Late,\" comprising songs all written or \nco-written by the artist. Production was handled by Jones' \nsongwriting partner/bassist Lee Alexander; indie \nsinger/songwriter M. Ward, Kronos Quartet cellist Jeff Ziegler \nand organist Larry Goldings make guest appearances. First single \"Thinking About You\" typifies an album full of \njazz- and soul-shaded arrangements, old-school organ and horns \nand Jones' honeyed vocals. KATHARINE McPHEE Title TBA (RCA, January 30) McPhee rushed off the road with the American Idols summer \ntour to build songs from scratch with such collaborators as \nTimbaland associate Nate Hill, Babyface, Kara DioGuardi and \nRyan Leslie. \"It's rhythm pop,\" she says of the album's sound. \n\"It's not like really R&B or really poppy, but there are a \ncouple of tracks that are really good for the 'American Idol' \nfans who voted for me and knew me as the 'Over the Rainbow' \ngirl.\"\n CLAP YOUR HANDS SAY YEAH Some Loud Thunder (self-released, January 30) The indie-rock darlings headed to upstate New York to \nrecord their second album with producer Dave Fridmann. Like the \nband's 2005 self-titled debut, \"Thunder\" will bypass a label \nand be worked directly through the Alternative Distribution \nAlliance. Look for plenty of what the Talking Heads-influenced \nrock bloggers have come to love, particularly the danceable \ntitle track.\n FALL OUT BOY Infinity on High (Island, February 6) Fall Out Boy thinks its third album will surprise its fans \n-- but hopefully in a good way. Vocalist/guitarist Patrick \nStump says the Chicago band's second major label set, the \nfollow-up to 2005's double-platinum \"From Under the Cork Tree,\" \ncuts a broader swath than its predecessors. \"From song to song there's a completely different feel, but \nthey all make sense in context,\" he says. \"They've got a few \ncommon points, but overall there's a lot of different voices \nand perspectives and styles. It would be dishonest for us to \nhold back any of these elements.\" As for the funky single \"This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms \nRace,\" Stump enthuses, \"It's basically a hip-hop/R&B song but \nwritten as a punk song.\"\n LUCINDA WILLIAMS West (Lost Highway, February 13) Loss and loneliness are at the core of Lucinda Williams' \neighth album, which finds her coping with another painful \nbreakup and the passing of her mother, about whom she \nreminisces in songs like \"Mama You Sweet\" and \"Fancy Funeral.\" \nWilliams says, \"It's probably been the most prolific time in my \nlife as a writer. I'd been through so many changes, so \nobviously there's a lot of pain and struggling, but it ends \nwith a look toward the future.\"\n CHARLIE LOUVIN Charlie Louvin (Tompkins Square, February 20) Wilco's Jeff Tweedy, Elvis Costello and George Jones are \namong the artists pitching in on country legend Louvin's first \nnew album in more than a decade. The artist, who turns 80 in \nJuly, also netted contributions from Will Oldham, Tom T. Hall, \nBobby Bare Sr., Marty Stuart, the Clean's David Kilgour and \nmembers of Lambchop, Superchunk, Bright Eyes and Clem Snide.\n LIL JON Crunk Rock (TVT, date TBA) Lil Jon is hard at work on \"Crunk Rock,\" for which the \nAtlanta producer is hoping to collaborate with Rick Rubin, Good \nCharlotte, Korn's Jonathan Davis and Green Day producer Rob \nCavallo. \"I ain't trying to save the world, and I ain't trying to \nreinvent the wheel,\" he says. \"I'm a give people what they know \nand love me for -- the crunk s--- and the nice club records for \nthe ladies to dance to. But also on this record, I've got live \nbands, crazy heavy metal and rock guitars, so it's a mixture.\" The track \"Act the Fool\" featuring Three 6 Mafia was \nrecently leaked on Jon's MySpace page.\n MODEST MOUSE We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank (Epic, date TBA) Modest Mouse reached previously unknown commercial heights \nwith 2004's \"Good News for People Who Love Bad News\" and its \nubiquitous hit \"Float On.\" But there are no mainstream-courting \nmaneuvers on its third Epic album, which introduces former \nSmiths guitarist Johnny Marr into the fold. Album opener/first single \"Dashboard\" rides in on a boogie \nriff and thudding kick drum, while \"Florida\" is a tight rocker \nwith a prominent hook and \"Fire It Up\" conjures vintage Modest \nMouse melancholy. But the best of the bunch is the \neight-minute-plus \"Spitting Venom,\" which blooms from a sleepy \nacoustic intro into a full-on psychedelic jam. The Shins' James \nMercer sings backup on three cuts.\n THE ARCADE FIRE Neon Bible (Merge, March 6) The Arcade Fire's \"Funeral\" was the runaway indie-rock \nsuccess story of 2005, selling 310,000 copies for Merge and \nattracting the support of Bono and David Bowie. The \nMontreal-based band spent significant chunks of 2006 working on \n\"Neon Bible\" and opted to self-produce the set. \"We kind of \nrealized that we already know how we want things to sound so we \nshould just run after that sound as fast as we can and not rely \non someone else to guide the good ship Arcade Fire,\" frontman \nWin Butler says. The pipe organ-laced \"Intervention\" was made available for \nsampling via a toll-free number on December 15, sending \nindie-rock blogs into a tizzy, and five London shows in late \nJanuary/early February sold out in two minutes.\n GUNS N' ROSES Chinese Democracy (Geffen, March 6) In late December, Axl Rose broke his silence to announce he \nhad parted ways with manager Merck Mercuriadis and that the \ndecade-in-the-making \"Chinese Democracy\" would finally arrive \nMarch 6. It's anybody's guess if the date will hold, but a \nmonster first week is a fair bet.\n AIR Pocket Symphony (Astralweks, March 6) Pulp's Jarvis Cocker and the Divine Comedy's Neil Hannon \nlend vocals to the French duo's latest, which is highlighted by \nthe sexy instrumental opener \"Space Maker\" and the \npulse-quickening electro-pop of \"Mer du Japon.\" Drown yourself \nin the bottle during the Cocker-sung \"Hell of a Party,\" a \nsomber reflection on the morning after.\n GOOD CHARLOTTE Good Morning Revival (Epic, March 20) \"It sounds like Good Charlotte,\" frontman Joel Madden says \nmatter-of-factly about the Don Gilmore-produced \"Good Morning \nRevival.\" \"It sounds older. We sound more comfortable.\" Indeed, \nthe first taste of new music was \"Keep Your Hands Off My Girl,\" \nwhich Madden wrote after deciding, \"I want to make a song I can \nhear in the club.\" The set also includes \"I Don't Want to Be Loved,\" a heavily \nproduced rocker in the vein of the Killers' \"Jenny Was a Friend \nof Mine,\" and first single \"The River,\" which features metal \nact Avenged Sevenfold.\n THE STOOGES The Weirdness (Virgin, March 20) So what does the first Stooges album since 1973 sound like? \nAccording to Iggy Pop, it sounds like, er, the Stooges. \"You \nput it on and right away you'd know, well, that's them. There \nthey go,\" he says of the project, which was recorded by Steve \nAlbini and finds bassist Mike Watt filling in for the late Dave \nAlexander.\n AVRIL LAVIGNE The Best Dam Thing (RCA, date TBA) This curiously spelled April release will be preceded by \nthe single \"Girlfriend\" in February and also features \ncontributions from Lavigne's husband, Sum 41's Derryck Whibley, \nas well as +44 drummer Travis Barker. \"It is really fast, fun, young, bratty, aggressive, \nconfident (and) cocky in a playful way . . . all the good \nstuff,\" Lavigne wrote on her MySpace page earlier this month, \nadding that she was inspired to make a more uptempo album after \nspending \"so much of my time playing live shows. I wanted to \nmake sure the songs were fun -- fun for the fans and myself. I \nwill only have, like, three slow songs on the record.\" \"The Best Dam Thing\" will be the follow-up to 2004's \"Under \nMy Skin,\" which debuted at No. 1 on The Billboard 200 and has \nsold 2.93 million copies.\n MANDY MOORE Wild Hope (Firm Music, date TBA) \"It means a lot to me to make something that's mine,\" \nstresses Moore, who has forgone music for acting during the \npast four years. \"It's a passion project,\" she says of \"Wild \nHope,\" her debut on the Firm's label. \"It won't matter if it \ndoesn't sell tons or have this high level of success.\" Moore's new set strips away the gloss from her earlier Sony \nMusic recordings and finds her collaborating with such acts as \nthe Weepies (on \"Extraordinary\" and the pop hit-in-waiting \"All \nGood Things\"), Lori McKenna (\"Most of Me\"), Rachael Yamagata \n(\"Ladies Choice\") and Chantal Kreviazuk (\"Gardenia\").\n THREE 6 MAFIA Title TBA (Sony, date TBA) In February, Three 6 Mafia became the first rap act to win \na best song Academy Award with \"It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp,\" \nbut what does it have cooking for its next album? \"So far, \nwe've got Chamillionaire, Lyfe Jennings, Paul Wall and Keke,\" \nDJ Paul says of contributors to the follow-up to 2005's \"Most \nKnown Unknown,\" which spawned the hits \"Stay Fly\" and \"Poppin' \nMy Collar.\" \"Mainly just friends -- people we actually hang out \nwith and go to bars with.\" Reuters/Billboard", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/04/music-bestbets-dc-idUSN0126591620070104", "sectors": [["Music"]], "title": "mellencamp , jones albums among early ' 07 releases"},
{"date": "23:01 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " (Adds additional comments from chief executive) By Poornima GuptaDEARBORN, Michigan Jan 3 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co.'s\n(F.N) restructuring is going well and the No. 2 U.S. auto maker\nwill decide on the sale of its Aston Martin sports car unit\nthis year, Chief Executive Alan Mulally said on Wednesday. \"It's going really well. It's really hard, really hard, but\nit is the right thing to do,\" said Mulally, who took the reins\nat Ford in September with a mandate to turn the struggling\ncompany around. \"The most important thing is to match the (production)\ncapacity to the current demand, restructure to operate\nprofitably,\" Mulally said at a media dinner, ahead of the\nDetroit auto show, at Ford's Dearborn design center. Ford's third turnaround plan in five years calls for the\ncompany to cut its work force by a third and close more than a\ndozen plants. It has also raised about $25 billion in cash\nthrough liens, bond offerings and credit lines. \"We clearly are at a turning point,\" said Mulally, who was\nhired from aircraft maker Boeing Co. \"I feel more confident now\nthan when I arrived that we can make a viable Ford.\" Mark Fields, Ford's president of the Americas, said Ford\nmade a progress on its restructuring in 2006. \"Last year, despite the numbers, was a year of incremental\nprogress for us,\" Fields said.  The company is drawing up a short list of bidders for\nAston Martin, its British premium brand. \"A decision will be made this year,\" Mulally said of the\nprospective sale. He also said the automaker continues to evaluate its brand\nportfolio and did not rule out eventually selling Ford's\nmoney-losing Jaguar luxury unit. Asked about his meeting in Tokyo last month with Toyota\nMotor Corp. (7203.T) Chairman Fujio Cho, Mulally said they\ndiscussed advanced technology and the regulatory environment\namong other things for about two hours, but declined to give\ndetails. Mulally said he admires the Japanese automaker for its\nmanufacturing processes and product development strategy. Asked if Ford was considering any kind of partnership with\nthe increasingly dominant Japanese automaker, Mulally said\nthere were opportunities to cooperate in technology and on free\ntrade agreements. \"We're always looking for opportunities to collaborate on\nall levels,\" he added. Industry analysts have speculated that Ford, which looks\nset to be overtaken this year by Toyota as the No. 2 seller of\nautomobiles in the United States, may be interested in Toyota's\nfuel-efficient hybrid engine technology. \"I really want to connect with each of the manufacturers\nand want to do it quickly. Because we have so many things in\ncommon that we have to deal with,\" Mulally said. He said he has also met with other auto makers - including\nGeneral Motors Corp.(GM.N) and DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE\nsince taking over as CEO. Ford in December managed to retain its No.2 spot in the\nU.S. market. Toyota had overtaken Ford in July and November\nlast year. Ford's overall U.S. sales, unadjusted for the number of\nselling days, slipped 13 percent in December and 8 percent for\n2006, partly because of lower demand for its best-selling\nF-Series pickup trucks. Ford also lost $7 billion through September of last year\nwith further losses forecast in the October-December quarter\nand beyond. By Ford's own estimate, its North American unit\nwill lose money until 2009 and run through $17 billion cash in\nthe next three years.\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/04/ford-mulally-idUSN0344465820070104", "sectors": [["M&A, ", "Bonds"]], "title": "update 2 - ford ceo says restructuring going well"},

It's really hard, really hard, but it is the right thing to do,\" said Mulally, who took the reins at Ford in September with a mandate to turn the struggling company around.\"The most important thing is to match the (production) capacity to the current demand, restructure to operate profitably,\" Mulally said at a media dinner, ahead of the Detroit auto show, at Ford's Dearborn design center.Ford's third turnaround plan in five years calls for the company to cut its work force by a third and close more than a dozen plants. It has also raised about $25 billion in cash through liens, bond offerings and credit lines.\"We clearly are at a turning point,\" said Mulally, who was hired from aircraft maker Boeing Co. \"I feel more confident now than when I arrived that we can make a viable Ford.\"Mark Fields, Ford's president of the Americas, said Ford made a progress on its restructuring in 2006.\"Last year, despite the numbers, was a year of incremental progress for us,\" Fields said.The company is drawing up a short list of bidders for Aston Martin, its British premium brand.\"A decision will be made this year,\" Mulally said of the prospective sale.He also said the automaker continues to evaluate its brand portfolio and did not rule out eventually selling Ford's money-losing Jaguar luxury unit.Asked about his meeting in Tokyo last month with Toyota Motor Corp. Chairman Fujio Cho, Mulally said they discussed advanced technology and the regulatory environment among other things for about two hours, but declined to give details.Mulally said he admires the Japanese automaker for its manufacturing processes and product development strategy.Asked if Ford was considering any kind of partnership with the increasingly dominant Japanese automaker, Mulally said there were opportunities to cooperate in technology and on free trade agreements.\"We're always looking for opportunities to collaborate on all levels,\" he added.Industry analysts have speculated that Ford, which looks set to be overtaken this year by Toyota as the No. 2 seller of automobiles in the United States, may be interested in Toyota's fuel-efficient hybrid engine technology.\"I really want to connect with each of the manufacturers and want to do it quickly. Because we have so many things in common that we have to deal with,\" Mulally said.He said he has also met with other auto makers - including General Motors Corp. and DaimlerChrysler AG since taking over as CEO.Ford in December managed to retain its No.2 spot in the U.S. market. Toyota had overtaken Ford in July and November last year.Ford's overall U.S. sales, unadjusted for the number of selling days, slipped 13 percent in December and 8 percent for 2006, partly because of lower demand for its best-selling F-Series pickup trucks.Ford also lost $7 billion through September of last year with further losses forecast in the October-December quarter and beyond. By Ford's own estimate, its North American unit will lose money until 2009 and run through $17 billion cash in the next three years.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/04/us-ford-mulally-idUSN0341592820070104", "sectors": [], "title": "ford ceo says restructuring going well"},

DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler unit was the lone U.S. automaker to post gains with adjusted sales rising 4 percent.Toyota's sales rose more than 16 percent, driven by strong demand for its Corolla and Camry sedans. Its December figures bring full-year sales to 2.54 million, surpassing DaimlerChrysler's 2.39 million.Toyota is expected to overtake GM as the world's largest automaker in 2007 and take second place in the United States.\"(Toyota) will be No. 2 in 2007,\" said Alex Rosten, an industry analyst with Edmunds.com. \"Ford has even conceded the fact that Toyota is going to overtake them as the No. 2 automaker in North America.\"Ford said sales were hurt by a 21 percent decline in sales of F-series pickup trucks -- its top-selling vehicle. Explorer sports utility vehicle (SUV) sales fell 29.5 percent. Overall truck sales were down 14 percent due to higher gas prices and a soft housing market.\"The (truck) segment will still continue to be under pressure ... at least in the early part of 2007,\" Ford sales analyst George Pipas said on a call. \"The new products will help offset some of the softness we are seeing in housing.\"Ford's car sales fell almost 10 percent.The combined monthly U.S. market share for Detroit's Big Three is estimated to be 54.3 percent in December, down from 56.6 percent a year earlier, according to Edmunds.com.Honda Motor Co. Ltd. said U.S. December sales rose 3 percent and Nissan North America Co. Ltd. said sales were up 4.4 percent, driven by demand for its new Altima, Sentra and Versa cars.Asian automakers have gained ground this year as consumers shifted away from larger, gas-guzzling SUVs to smaller sports utility models or cars.Toyota, Nissan, Honda and Hyundai Motor Co. Ltd. have relied on cars in the U.S. market, while domestic automakers have focused on larger SUVs and trucks, which account for at least 60 percent of their sales.Industry-wide sales ran at an annualized rate of 16.8 million vehicles for December, in line with analysts' estimates and down from 17.1 million a year earlier.GM'S TRANSACTION PRICE UPGM's average U.S. transaction price on vehicles rose 8 percent in December from the prior year, a top company official told reporters and analysts on Wednesday.Paul Ballew, GM's chief sales analyst, said transaction prices were up 7 percent during the fourth quarter and up 2 percent for 2006.\"They held the line on incentives and their transaction prices actually improved,\" Rosten said of GM, which is in the middle of a broad restructuring after losing $10.6 billion in 2005.\"Lower sales volume isn't necessarily a bad thing if you are making more money per unit,\" Rosten said, adding that GM had spent the least per vehicle on incentives since April 2002.The Big Three are all cutting production as they try to align capacity with demand. GM on Wednesday cut its first- quarter production forecast by 20,000 to 1.120 million vehicles, saying it was to reduce low-margin daily rental fleet sales.GM had also cut its 2006 fourth-quarter production by 13 percent, while Ford forecast a 22 percent cut and Chrysler reduced second-half production by as much as 17 percent.JP Morgan analyst Himanshu Patel expects GM will likely cut production further in 2007.\"GM ended with 1.05 million units in inventory, roughly flat with last year, and could still hold risks for 07 production,\" Patel said in a note to clients.(Additional reporting by Poornima Gupta in Detroit and David Bailey in Chicago)", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/04/us-autos-sales-idUSN0339857020070104", "sectors": [], "title": "toyota joined the big three in 2006"},

U.S. Treasury debt prices and U.S. rate futures inched up, \nreflecting a view that chances of the Fed cutting interest \nrates in the first half of 2007 have increased after the \nminutes. Stocks pared gains and the dollar slipped. \"The biggest change is the they are showing a little more \nanxiety about the economy,\" said Sam Rahman, a portfolio \nmanager for Baring Asset Management Inc., in Boston. \"While inflation remains a key focus, the FOMC is showing \nclearer signs that the weakening economic environment has \nraised concerns,\" he said. The U.S. central bank at that meeting held benchmark \ninterest rates steady at 5.25 percent, renewing a warning on \ninflation but also nodding to \"mixed\" economic signals and a \n\"substantial\" housing slowdown. The minutes show one member of the policy-setting committee \nwas concerned enough about growth to favor a statement saying \nmonetary policy could be adjusted in either direction. The statement the Fed issued last month said only that \nadditional firming -- increases in interest rates -- might be \nnecessary to address risks from inflation. Participants in the policy-making Federal Open Market \nCommittee meeting said the slowdown in the housing sector \ncontinued to weigh heavily on economic activity in the United \nStates. Although there was evidence that home sales might be \nstabilizing, residential investment was likely to fall further \nin coming quarters as builders reduced inventories, officials \nfelt. The housing slowdown has not spilled over significantly \ninto consumer spending, but \"considerable uncertainty\" \nsurrounding housing activity meant its impact on spending could \neventually become more evident, especially if house prices \ndecline significantly, officials said. At the same time, central bank officials said a slowdown in \nbusiness investment and production, along with high inventories \nfor automobiles and in other sectors, added to a picture of \nslowing economic expansion. All of the participants in the meeting remained concerned \nabout inflation, the minutes said. \"Although readings on core inflation had improved modestly \nsince the spring, nearly all participants viewed core inflation \nas uncomfortably high and stressed the importance of further \nmoderation,\" the minutes said. The FOMC saw \"considerable uncertainty\" regarding how much \nand how fast core inflation would recede and believed that the \nrisks around the desired downward path remained to the upside.", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/04/businesspro-usa-fed-minutes-dc-idUSTRT00019020070104", "sectors": [["Bonds"]], "title": "some at fed saw risks to growth increased : minutes"},

{"date": "23:37 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": " (Adds details, changes date, company comment) By Doug Young and Sinead CarewTAIPEI/NEW YORK Jan 4 (Reuters) - SMIC (0981.HK), the\nworld's third-largest microchip foundry, said on Thursday it is\nconstantly looking for ways to boost shareholder value but would\nnot comment on a takeover report that drove its U.S. shares 22\npercent higher. U.S shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.\n(0981.HK) (SMI.N) soared on Wednesday as investors speculated\nthat the Chinese chip maker had been targeted by private equity\nfirms, Bank of America analyst Mark Fitzgerald said. But other analysts were uncertain what had driven the rally. One source familiar with the situation told Reuters that\nmajor private equity names had approached SMIC previously, but\ntalks had never advanced because of management issues. \"The directors of the company are always looking at strategic\nand/or other opportunities to enhance shareholder value for the\ncompany,\" SMIC said in a Hong Kong exchange filing. \"No decision has been made about any resulting transaction.\nThere is no certainty that any opportunity will or will not\nresult in any transaction by or involving the company or its\nsubsidiaries.\" SMIC's Hong Kong shares have jumped 21 percent since the\nstart of the year, and rose 22 percent in New York on the first\ntrading day of 2007 after a four-day break. But the stock was down 2.44 percent in Hong Kong on Thursday\nat HK$1.20, the same day Taiwan's Economic Daily -- without\nciting sources -- reported that private equity interests intended\nto make a bid for the Shanghai-based firm. Private equity firms have been investing in the chip industry\nand exploring fast-growing markets like China. The firm's largest shareholders as of Nov. 30 were Shanghai\nIndustrial Holdings (0363.HK) with 10 percent and the city of\nShanghai with 4.7 percent, according to Reuters Research. Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) is the next biggest shareholder with\n3 percent, followed by mostly small shareholders. \"Investors have seen so many private equity deals they're now\nstarting to shop around for what the next one could be,\"\nFitzgerald said. \"SMIC screens as a potential target because of\nits valuation and its exposure to the Chinese market place.\" ON THE PROWL? Last year, a private equity consortium bought chip maker\nFreescale Semiconductor, and another private equity group made a\nbid for Taiwan's Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Inc.\n(2311.TW) (ASX.N). Fitzgerald added that SMIC's valuation might be attractive as\nit has traded close to its book value of $5 in recent months. \"You could see where a financial entity might want to come in\nand say we could really shake up this thing,\" he said. SMIC's shares closed up almost 13 percent in Hong Kong on\nWednesday after rising 9 percent on Tuesday, when the New York\nStock Exchange was closed, amid a broader rally that lifted Hong\nKong's blue-chip index to record highs. However, other analysts said they were unsure why SMIC's U.S.\nshares were up. Two other sources active in Shanghai's semiconductor industry\nsaid they had no knowledge of any recent acquisition discussions. One said any sale by Chinese government-backed entities would\nbe unlikely, as China -- which has heavily subsidised SMIC via\ndirect and indirect means -- is more interested in developing its\nsemiconductor industry than earning a quick profit. SMIC has reported losses in five of the last six quarters,\naccording to Reuters Estimates, as it was hit harder than most of\nits peers during an industry downturn that has shown signs of\nbottoming out. Prior to this week's rally, SMIC's shares had languished in\nthe nearly three years since the company raised $1.8 billion in\nan initial public offering in Hong Kong and New York. Even at their current level, the stock now trades at less\nthan half of their IPO price of HK$2.69 per share.\n\n\n", "link": "http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/04/smic-shares-idUSTP14897920070104", "sectors": [["M&A"]], "title": "update 1 - top china foundry ' s us shares soar on takeover talk"},

{"date": "22:12 03 January 2007 (UTC)", "text": "TOKYO Jan 4 The dollar steadied against the yen\nand the euro on Thursday after rallying the previous session on\na survey that showed a surprising expansion in U.S. factory\nactivity in December. The dollar jumped on Wednesday after the Institute for\nSupply Management (ISM) said its manufacturing index climbed to\n51.4 from 49.5 in November, above the 50 threshold that\nseparates expansion from contraction. Analysts had forecast a\nreading of 49.9.\n The data reinforced expectations for a soft-landing in the\nU.S. economy and lent support to the dollar, said Kikuko Takeda,\ncurrency strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. \"Pessimism has been receding and it seems all right to think\na soft-landing is the main scenario,\" said Takeda.\n The dollar was at 119.35 yen JPY= as of 0300 GMT, little\nchanged from the level in late U.S. trading on Wednesday, when\nit rose to a 2-\u00bd   month high of 119.68 yen. The euro was nearly flat at $1.3172 EUR=, after falling\n0.9 percent on Wednesday, its biggest one-day decline since\nmid-July of last year. The euro was flat at 157.22 yen EURJPY=R after hitting a\nrecord high of 158.06 yen on electronic trading platform EBS on\nWednesday. YEN ON DEFENSIVE Market players said the yen continued to look vulnerable\nafter also having fallen to fresh eight-year lows against\nsterling GBPJPY=R and nine-year lows versus the Australian\ndollar AUDJPY=R this week, dragged down by its low-yielding\nstatus. Such falls in the yen occurred despite the possibility of\nthe Bank of Japan raising interest rates as early as the two-day\npolicy meeting that starts on Jan. 17. Even if the BOJ boosts rates this month, the yen's weak\ntrend is unlikely to be reversed, traders and analysts said,\nadding that any subsequent hikes would probably come only\ngradually. \"Even if rates are raised in January or February, I think\nthe consensus (market) view is that any subsequent action is\nonly likely to be taken after the upper house elections,\" said\nTakeda at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, referring to parliamentary\nelections in July.
