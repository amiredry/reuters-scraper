Chairman John Malone is gauging the interest of Cablevision 
Systems Corp.'s (CVC.N) controlling family in selling its 
Rainbow Media unit, the New York Post reported on Wednesday. Citing sources familiar with the matter, the Post said the 
talks amount to "informal chatter between friendly moguls." Rainbow Media, which manages the AMC, IFC and WE: Women's 
Entertainment cable television networks, is a subsidiary of 
Cablevision, which is controlled by the Dolan family. The talks could become more serious as Cablevision 
shareholders become increasingly restless with the company's 
silence on a decision on the family's $19.2 billion buyout 
proposal, the Post said, citing sources. Cablevision has set up a special committee to review the 
family's offer, but has yet to publicly approve or reject it. A deal for Rainbow's programming assets could generate more 
than $2 billion, the Post reported. A Cablevision spokesman declined to comment. Liberty 
officials were not immediately available for comment. Malone last month agreed to swap an $11 billion stake in 
News Corp. NWSa.N for control of satellite TV provider 
DirecTV Group Inc. DTV.N and other assets.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/businesspro-cablevision-liberty-dc-idUSN0337203620070103</link><sectors><value><value>M&amp;A</value></value></sectors><title>liberty media eyes cablevision unit : report</title></story></items>
