rating on department store operator Kohl's Corp. (KSS.N) to
"neutral" from "buy" and reduced its price target to $72 from
$78. In a research note, the brokerage said the market share
opportunity that helped retailers and particularly department
stores in 2006 will diminish in 2007. Also, though the company is expected to continue improving
product, presentation and marketing, the rate of change in 2007
will be more modest than in 2006. These factors are expected to result in more modest
comparable store sales and earnings results for Kohl's, the
brokerage added. The brokerage also said it expects the company's December
same-store sales to grow 2 percent to 4 percent, in line with
expectations. Shares of the company closed at $68.43 Friday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
