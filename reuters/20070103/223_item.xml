gains on Wednesday after a higher-than-expected index of national
factory activity from the Institute for Supply Management. The December ISM manufacturing index came in at 51.4, above
analysts' expectations for a reading of 49.9 and above the
November reading of 49.5. A reading above 50 indicates growth in
the sector. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR_were trading 5/32 higher
in price for a yield of 4.66 percent from 4.68 percent late on
Tuesday, while two-year notes US2YT=RR_were trading 2/32 higher
in price for a yield of 4.78 percent from 4.81 percent.
