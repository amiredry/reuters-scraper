pay $7.8 million to settle a class action lawsuit that arose
from its 2004 restatement of financial results. Quovadx will pay the amount by Jan. 15 into a settlement
fund established by the lead plaintiffs' counsel in exchange
for a release with prejudice of all claims that were or could
have been asserted, it said in a statement. The software company said it expects an additional
settlement expense of $4.5 million, or about 11 cents a share,
in the fourth quarter. It had previously estimated about 8
cents a share as the settlement amount in the first quarter of
2006.
