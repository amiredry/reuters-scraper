following stories on its front page on Wednesday. Reuters has
not verified these stories and does not vouch for their
accuracy. * Saddam Hussein was subjected to a battery of taunts by
official Shiite witnesses and guards as he awaited his hanging. * A recommendation would make New Jersey the first state in
over 35 years to abolish the death penalty. * Google (GOOG.O) is starting to look for well-rounded
candidates, like those who have published books or started their
own clubs. * The one factor that researchers agree is consistently
linked to longer lives in every country is education. * Driven by slumps in learning and by high dropout rates,
educators are struggling to rethink middle school. (Editing by Rory Channing; New York Newsroom: 646-223-6000)
