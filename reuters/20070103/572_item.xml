fourth-quarter earnings outlook, citing a projected tonnage
decline at its less-than truckload operating unit, among other
factors. The trucking and logistics company said it now expects
earnings from continuing operations of 72 cents to 76 cents a
share. Its previous earnings outlook was 81 cents to 87 cents a
share. The outlook excludes an expected gain from the sale of
Vector SCM LLC, the company's logistics joint venture with
General Motors Corp. (GM.N). Con-way expects the pre-tax gain
from the transaction to be in the range of $40 million to $41
million. For the fourth quarter, analysts expect the company to earn
78 cents a share, excluding items, according to Reuters
estimates.
 San Mateo, California-based company said the revised outlook
reflected 4 cents a share from vehicular casualty insurance
expense and a curtailment charge of 2 cents a share related to
changes in defined benefit pension plan.
