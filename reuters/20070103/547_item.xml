began in earnest Tuesday, with NBC greenlighting three one-hour 
projects, including a new take on "The Bionic Woman." The original series, a spin-off from "The Six Million 
Dollar Man," starred Lindsay Wagner as a woman whose body is 
mechanically enhanced to save her life. It ran on ABC and then 
NBC for three seasons in the mid-1970s. NBC's order is 
contingent on casting. The other pilots in NBC's order are a cop show and a spy 
comedy-drama. "Fort Pit" is a drama with comedic elements set at one of 
the worst NYPD police precincts in Brooklyn where bad cops are 
sent to live out their careers and rookie cops with no 
connections are stationed. The project is based on the 
real-life experiences of former NYPD cop Robert Cea. It comes from "Law &amp; Order" veteran Michael Chernuchin, and 
"Rescue Me" creators Denis Leary and Peter Tolan. For Leary and Tolan, "Pit" marks a return to the cop genre 
following their critically praised ABC comedy "The Job," which 
also was set in New York. The duo's FX drama "Rescue Me" 
follows a group of New York firefighters. "Chuck," from "The O.C." creator Josh Schwartz, is 
described as a high-concept action dramedy about spies and 
twentysomethings in the vein of "Grosse Pointe Blank."
