Wednesday after stronger-than-expected U.S. construction and
manufacturing data eased worries about the scope of a slowdown
in the world's biggest economy, but miners continued to weigh. Data showing a rebound in the U.S. industrial sector in
December calmed fears of a sharper slowdown in factory activity.
The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national
factory activity climbed to 51.4 from 49.5 in November -- above
the 50 threshold that separates growth from contraction. Wall Street forecasts had centered around 49.9. Separately, U.S. construction spending fell a
smaller-than-expected 0.2 percent in November. At 1510 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European
shares .FTEU3 was down 0.1 percent at 1,500.66 points, still
weighed by mining stocks such as Antofagasta (ANTO.L), which
fell in step with tumbling copper prices.
