Wednesday said its European unit acquired $30 million of newly
issued shares of Ironshore Inc., a start-up Bermuda specialty
insurance company. Greenhill said the stake, purchased on Dec. 28, will later
be acquired by a merchant banking fund to be launched during
the first half of this year. Ironshore, founded by insurance industry veteran Robert
Clements, has raised more than $1 billion through a private
share placement of shares. The company intends to begin
underwriting specialty insurance immediately. Formed more than a year after hurricanes battered New
Orleans and Mississippi, Ironshore plans to underwrite property
policies with a focus on wind exposure in U.S. coastal states,
as well as in the Caribbean and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. The start-up also will underwrite commercial earthquake
coverage in California. Ironshore is the latest insurance venture by Clements, who
was a top executive and director at Marsh &amp; McLennan (MMC.N)
for 16 years. Clements, with Robert Newhouse, founded Bermuda
insurers Ace (ACE.N) and XL Capital (XL.N). More recently Clements helped found Mid-Ocean Ltd., SCUUL
Underwriters and Arch Capital Group Ltd. (ACGL.O). In 2005 he
helped launch New York-based Integro Insurance Brokers.
