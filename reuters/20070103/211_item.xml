tool maker, said it agreed to buy Federal Signal Corp.'s
(FSS.N) three cutting-tool units for about $67 million to add
another component to its metalworking business. Kennametal said the deal will add to its earnings within
the next year and that it expects to close the transaction by
late January or early February. The deal comprises the Manchester Tool Co., ClappDiCO Corp.
and On Time Machine Inc. units and is consistent with
Kennametal's previously stated intentions for the use of cash,
the company said in a statement. In a separate statement Federal Signal said it expects to
recognize a gain on the transaction and added that the sale
will be modestly dilutive based on 2006 earnings. The three Ohio-based units together generate annual sales
of about $40 million, Federal Signal said.
