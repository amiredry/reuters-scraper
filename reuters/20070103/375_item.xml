(6758.T) that settles a dispute over digital camera and imaging technology patents, and grants each company access to the other's patents.Kodak also set a similar cross licensing agreement with Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB, a venture of Sony Corp. and Ericsson (ERICb.ST).Financial terms were not disclosed, but Kodak said the agreements were royalty-bearing to Kodak. In a separate statement, Sony Corp. said the license and settlement will have no material effect on its previously announced earnings forecast.Kodak in March 2004 sued Sony, alleging that the Japanese consumer electronics company infringed several of Kodak's patents related to digital photography. The fight intensified one month later when Sony sued Kodak over different imaging patents.Kodak and Sony are two of the biggest makers of digital cameras, and their products range from printers and Hollywood movie technology to personal digital music players and televisions.A Kodak spokesman declined to speculate on the types of products that the cross licensing agreement might yield.Kodak is undergoing a lengthy and expensive transformation into a maker of digital cameras and printing products and services, hoping to outpace the drop in demand for traditional photographic film, historically its main revenue source.Shares of Kodak rose 38 cents, or about 1.4 percent, to $26.18 in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. traded shares of Sony (SNE.N) rose 32 cents to $43.15.(Additional reporting by Ritsuko Ando)</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-kodak-sony-idUSN0339829220070103</link><sectors><value><value>Tech</value></value></sectors><title>kodak sets licensing with sony , ends patent fight</title></story></items>
