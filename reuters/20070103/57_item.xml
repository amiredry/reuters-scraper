star of NBC's rookie hit "Heroes," is putting on his poker face 
for the casino-set thriller "21." The film is inspired by the true story of a group of men 
who learned the art of card counting and won millions of 
dollars gambling. Oka is in talks to play a supporting role. The Columbia Pictures project is based on Ben Mezrich's 
best-seller "Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six 
M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions." Jim Sturgess will star in the long-gestating project, which 
picked up steam last year when director Robert Luketic dropped 
out of a big-screen adaptation of "Dallas" to take the helm of 
"21." The blackjack tale is scheduled to begin shooting in 
February in Boston and Las Vegas. Oka, who once appeared on the cover of Time magazine under 
the headline "Those Asian-American Whiz Kids," worked for years 
as a computer-animation artist at George Lucas' Industrial 
Light and Magic on such films as "Pirates of the Caribbean: 
Dead Man's Chest" and the recent "Star Wars" trilogy. He is 
nominated for a Golden Globe for his role as Hiro Nakamura on 
"Heroes." Reuters/Hollywood Reporter</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/film-oka-dc-idUSN0228321220070103</link><sectors><value><value>Film</value></value></sectors><title>heroes star all in for 21 thriller</title></story></items>
