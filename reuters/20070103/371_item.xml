Bush said on Wednesday the budget he presents to Congress next month will aim to balance the budget by 2012 and make lower tax rates permanent."Next month I will submit a five-year budget proposal that will balance the federal budget by 2012," Bush said after a meeting at the White House with top administration officials.Bush said the budget would address "priorities" like "the need to keep this economy growing by making tax relief permanent."Balancing the budget in the given timeframe would require substantial spending discipline, given that recent projections by the White House showed it expected a budget gap of $127 billion by 2011.Bush also said entitlement programs for retired Americans and for medical care need reform. "We need to reform Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid so future generations of Americans can benefit from these vital programs without bankrupting our economy," Bush said.The Bush administration tried unsuccessfully in the past to reform Social Security, proposing to make private savings accounts a part of the retirement program in an effort that was rejected by the public and by Democrats.Bush faces a Democrat-controlled Congress after elections last November that cost his Republican party its majorities in the Senate and U.S. House of Representatives, and he suggested both parties could work together to curb wasteful spending."One important message we all should take from the elections is that people want to end the secretive process by which Washington insiders are able to get billions of dollars directed to projects, many of them pork-barrel projects that have never been reviewed or voted on by the Congress," Bush said.</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-bush-budget-idUSWBT00636320070103</link><sectors><value><value>U.S., </value><value>Politics, </value><value>Bonds</value></value></sectors><title>bush aims to balance budget by 2012</title></story></items>
