a benchmark for small-cap stocks, finished 2006 with a gain of
18.4 percent, outperforming the large-cap Russell 1000 Index
.RUI for the seventh year out of the past eight, Russell
Investment Group said on Wednesday. The Russell 1000 returned 15.5 percent last year. "Every time the large-cap segment picked up some momentum
in performance relative to small caps in 2006, it didn't last
long," David Hintz, an analyst at Russell said in a statement. Starting in 1999, the small-cap index has done better than
the large-cap index in every year except 2005. Russell said that the U.S. stock market showed strength
across the board last year, with each of its 26 U.S. equity
indices posting a positive return. Value stocks outperformed growth stocks in each
capitalization tier, the report said. The best-performing Russell index was the Russell 2000
Value Index, which returned 23.5 percent last year. Strength in integrated oils and utilities, usually
considered value sectors, combined with relative
underperformance in technology and health care, contributed to
the outperformance of value over growth last year, Hintz said.
