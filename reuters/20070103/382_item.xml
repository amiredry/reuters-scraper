on Wednesday let stand an earlier ruling that reinstated a
patent infringement case filed by a Schering AG SCHG.DE
affiliate against Tyco Healthcare.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit turned
down a request to review its previous decision from October,
without comment. In the earlier ruling, the appeals court reversed a
decision by a lower court judge who had thrown out the case
against Tyco Healthcare, a unit of Tyco International Ltd.
(TYC.N). The patent case was filed in 2001 by Medrad Inc., a
Schering affiliate based in Pennsylvania, and centers on an
infusion system used with magnetic resonance imaging.
