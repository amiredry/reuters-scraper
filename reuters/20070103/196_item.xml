which is trying to rebound from accounting problems, said on
Wednesday that John Ward resigned as non-executive chairman
amid disagreement about the future of Puerto Rico's largest
mortgage lender. Dennis Buchert, an independent director who joined the
board in October, was named Ward's replacement. Doral said Ward's decision to resign reflected his
"different views as to the best process to be followed by the
company to meet its capital and liquidity needs and maximize
shareholder value."
