597-megawatt Unit 5 at the Eastlake coal-fired station in Ohio
shut by early Wednesday, according to electricity traders. A spokeswoman at FirstEnergy said the Akron, Ohio based
company does not comment on the operating status of its power
plants due to competitive reasons. A couple of traders said the company planned to shut the
unit soon for about a month to work on the turbine. The traders
however could not say whether the current outage was part of the
planned shutdown for the turbine work. The 1,257 MW Eastlake station is located in Lake County
about 20 miles northeast of Cleveland, Ohio, along Lake Erie.
There are six units at the station most of which are fueled by
bituminous and subbituminous coal, including three 132 MW Units
1-3, the 240 MW Unit 4, the 597 MW Unit 5 and an oil-fired 24 MW
Unit 6. Units 1-3 entered service in 1953 and 1954. Unit 4 entered
service in 1956, Unit 5 in 1972 and Unit 6 in 1973. FirstEnergy owns and operates nearly 14,000 MW of generating
capacity, markets energy commodities, and transmits and
distributes electricity to about 4.5 million customers in Ohio,
Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
