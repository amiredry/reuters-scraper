said on Wednesday it expects to report "a modest loss" for the
fourth quarter, but to be profitable for full-year 2006, due to a
decline in passenger traffic and weaker yields from increased
competition along the East Coast. Wall Street analysts, on average, expect the company to earn
10 cents a share in the fourth quarter and 34 cents a share for
the full year, according to Reuters Estimates. The company said its December passenger load factor, which
measures the amount of available capacity filled, rose 0.4 percent
from a year earlier to 70.4 percent, but was down 2.5 points to 69
percent for the full fourth quarter. AirTran said it expects its fourth revenue per available seat
mile to drop by 6.5 to 7.5 percent compared with fourth quarter
2005. The company said that, based on published future schedules,
capacity increases in its key competitive markets are expected to
moderate in the first quarter of 2007. AirTran said its fourth quarter costs remain on target with
fuel costs expected at $2.00 to $2.05 a gallon. The company
expects fourth quarter non-fuel costs to drop about 3 percent. The company's shares, which rose 2.7 percent to close at
$12.06 on the New York Stock Exchange, were halted in after hours
trading.
