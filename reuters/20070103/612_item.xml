legal action against a former chief executive in a bid to
recover 600,000 pounds ($1.18 million) the supermarket chain
says it paid mistakenly in tax on his share options when he
quit in 2000, the Financial Times reported on Thursday. The retailer, owned by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT.N), said
it had issued a claim against Allan Leighton in the High Court,
having "exhausted every other option," the newspaper said. "The only reason we're taking this to court is because the
six-year time limit to take court action and make a claim
against him was drawing to an end," Asda was quoted as saying
in a statement. "We simply can't say goodbye to 600,000 pounds -- the
thousands of colleagues working in our stores would expect us
to do nothing less," it said. Asda was not immediately available for comment.
