Corp. MVSN.O said on Tuesday it paid about $43.5 million to
buy privately-held Mediabolic in a cash deal aimed at tapping
growing consumer demand for playing digital content such as
movies on a variety of devices. The acquisition helps Macrovision provide consumer
electronics makers with tools to create devices that display
Internet-based content such as digital photos, video and movies
on machines ranging from televisions to mobile phones, the
companies said. "Your content becomes available anyplace, any time,
regardless of the device," privately held Mediabolic founder
and chief executive Dan Putterman said in a telephone
interview. Macrovision is known for software used to protect movies,
music and games from unauthorized copying, but sees its latest
acquisition as a way to help push into new areas. Macrovision Chief Executive Fred Amoroso noted that, while
there has been explosive growth of television programming and
movies available on the Internet, most consumers at the moment
limit the content to personal computers. But he sees growing demand from consumers who want to view
Internet-based content on a broader number of devices and said
Mediabolic's software enables consumer electronics companies to
create products capable of doing this. Macrovision also said the cash deal for all outstanding
Mediabolic shares would add to earnings by 2008, but hurt its
2007 per-share profit by as much as 10 cents.
