to more than 45.5 billion soles ($14.3 billion) last year on
robust economic growth, the government's tax service said on
Wednesday. Tax receipts made up 15 percent of the Andean nation's
gross domestic product, which was the highest level in 26
years, the service, known as SUNAT, said in a statement. The government has put Peruvian 2006 economic growth at 7.5
percent -- the strongest rate since 1995. Peru's economy has been enjoying an unprecedented run of
robust growth since 2002, fueled by exports and construction
boom amid strong consumer spending.
