main index shed more than 200 points on Wednesday, as investors
bailed out of sinking resource and energy issues, dragging down
the broader market. The S&amp;P/TSX composite index .GSPTSE fell 201.47 points,
or 1.6 percent, to 12,722.19 shortly after 2 p.m., extending a
steep retreat that first hit the benchmark shortly after
trading began. The energy and resource-heavy materials groups led the
decline, falling 4 percent and 3.9 percent respectively The top net losers' list on Wednesday read like a "Who's
Who" of the energy and mining industries, as investors soured
on the shares on concerns over underlying commodity prices. Zinc giant Teck Cominco Ltd. (TCKb.TO) sank C$4.53, or 5.3
percent, to C$81.40. First Quantum Minerals (FM.TO) fell
C$7.10, or 11.5 percent, C$54.40. Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd.
(AEM.TO) gave up C$3.96, or 8.1 percent, to C$45.19. Among energy names, Suncor Energy Inc. (SU.TO) dove C$4.15,
or 4.6 percent, to C$86.87. Nexen Inc. NXY.TO was down
C$2.79, or 4.3 percent, at C$61.82. The losses first hit the TSX this morning as concern
mounted over oil sinking to below $60 a barrel due to warm
weather in the United States, which ate into heating oil
demand. Base metals prices, responsible for the declines in the
materials group, also fell on Wednesday, led by copper which
touched its lowest levels since April. ($1=$1.17 Canadian)
