Inc. (CPRX.O) said on Wednesday that it was decreasing the
number of patients it would study in a mid-stage trial of its
experimental treatment for cocaine and methamphetamine
addiction. The drug maker said it believed the new trial design of
between 100 and 150 patients, down from 375, would speed it
toward its final late-stage study required by U.S. regulators
for approval. The new trial design will trim development costs, although
the company did not specify by how much. It expects to have
results on the cocaine addiction trial in the second quarter of
fiscal 2008 and results for methamphetamine addiction shortly
after that. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted the drug
"fast track" status, giving it a faster-than-typical review
time by regulators.
