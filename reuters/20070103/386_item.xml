 Rating              Strong buy         Outperform
 Price target        $50                $47 --The upgrade by Raymond James comes after the company said
its Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Nardelli resigned. The
brokerage said 2007 was likely to be a better year than 2006
for the home building retailer, its management, and the stock. --The brokerage said the launch of a proxy fight by an
investor to elect two board members, and conduct a review of
the company strategy, management performance, and strategic
options will boost the share price in the near term. --Raymond James said it expected the Home Depot stock to
move higher as the earnings outlook clears. A recent $3 billion
accelerated share repurchase and recently increased dividend
provide additional support for the shares, it added.
