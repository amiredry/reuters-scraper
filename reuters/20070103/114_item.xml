last week, led by an increase in demand for home purchase loans
even as interest rates climbed for a fourth consecutive week,
an industry trade group said on Wednesday. The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally
adjusted index of mortgage application activity for the week
ended Dec. 29 increased 3.6 percent to 575.6. The index stood
at 555.8 in the previous week, which was its lowest level since
early August. Borrowing costs on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, excluding
fees, averaged 6.22 percent, up 0.10 percentage point from the
previous week. Four weeks prior, 30-year mortgage rates sank to
5.98 percent, the lowest level since October 2005. Interest rates were also above year-ago levels of 6.15
percent. The MBA's seasonally adjusted purchase index, which is
considered a timely gauge of U.S. home sales, rose 4.3 percent
to 406.9. The index, however, was below its year-ago level of
418.3. The group's seasonally adjusted index of refinancing
applications increased 2.2 percent to 1,640.4.
