Cytokinetics Inc. (CYTK.O) on Wednesday announced a
collaboration to develop heart failure drugs that could yield
smaller Cytokinetics more than $600 million depending on
development success. Cytokinetics is receiving an up-front fee of $42 million.
In addition, Amgen has purchased nearly 3.5 million shares of
Cytokinetics at $9.47 per share, or an aggregate price of about
$33 million. Cytokinetics shares closed last Friday at $7.48. Amgen gained an option to participate in development and
commercialization of Cytokinetics' lead drug candidate arising
from the heart-failure program, CK-1827452, which recently
completed two Phase 1 clinical trials. Cytokinetics also may receive milestone payments of up to
$600 million on CK-1827452 and other products arising from the
research as well as royalties, the companies said.
