"Fortunately they know how to appreciate life and good wine."</text><link>http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/03/us-france-cinema-idUSL0311554320070103</link><sectors><value><value>Entertainment, </value><value>Film</value></value></sectors><title>french critics slam crowe ' s romance in provence</title></story></items>
