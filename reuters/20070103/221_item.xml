fell a smaller-than-expected 0.2 percent in November, led by an
eighth straight drop in private residential building that more
than offset all-time highs in nonresidential and public
construction, a government report said on Wednesday. Construction spending fell to $1.184 trillion in November. Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted a sharper 0.5
percent drop in overall construction spending in November.
Compared with a year ago, total spending was up 0.1 percent,
according to the Commerce Department. The overall drop was driven by a 1.6 percent decline in
private residential construction and a 0.6 percent drop in
private construction. November saw the eighth straight monthly
drop in private construction. Public construction, namely government building projects,
rose 1.0 percent to an all-time high of $278.4 billion. Private
nonresidential construction saw a 1.4 percent boost in spending
to reach $316.5 billion, the highest level ever. Construction spending in October was revised to $1.187
trillion, a decline of 0.3 percent. The decline was initially
reported as 1.0 percent.
